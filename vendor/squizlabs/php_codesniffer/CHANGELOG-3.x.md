# Changelog

The file documents changes to the PHP_CodeSniffer project for the 3.x series of releases.


## [3.13.6] - 2026-08-06

**This is a security release and all users are advised to update their install(s) as soon as possible.**

### Changed
- Various housekeeping, including improvements to the tests and documentation.
    - Thanks to [Sergei Morozov][@morozov] and [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for their contributions.

### Fixed
- **SECURITY FIX**: Running PHP_CodeSniffer over untrusted files, for example, in a CI pipeline that scans pull requests, or on a developer machine reviewing third-party code, could result in attacker-controlled shell commands being executed when the `Gitblame`, `Hgblame` or `Svnblame` report(s) would process a file whose name contains shell metacharacters. [#1473]
    - Users using the default `Full` report, or any of the other non-*blame reports, are not affected.
    - For more details, see the [security advisory][sec-1].
    - Thanks go to [Faze-up][@Faze-up] and [Volker Dusch][@edorian] for responsibly disclosing the vulnerability.
    - Additionally, thanks go to [Volker Dusch][@edorian], [Rodrigo Primo][@rodrigoprimo], [Dan Wallis][@fredden] and [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for creating and testing the fix.

### Other
- The GPG signature for the PHAR files has been rotated. The new fingerprint is: 5CB4F778BF9BC4FB67AE511D96E91A992CF22FF4.

    - Thanks to [Andrew Lyons][@andrewnicols] for the patch.
- Fixed bug [#1279]: Tokenizer/PHP: on PHP < 8.0, an unclosed attribute (parse error) could end up removing some tokens from the token stream.
    - This could lead to false positives and false negative from sniffs, but could also lead to incorrect fixes being made mangling the file under scan.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer](https://github.com/jrfnl) for the patch.

### Other
- Please be aware that the `master` branch has been renamed to `3.x` and the default branch has changed to the `4.x` branch.

## [3.12.0] - 2025-03-18

### Added
- Added support for PHP 8.4 `final` properties to File::getMemberProperties() through a new `is_final` array index in the return value. [#834]
    - Thanks to [Daniel Scherzer][@DanielEScherzer] for the patch.
- Generators/HTML: each section title now has a unique anchor link, which can be copied when hovering over a title. [#859]
    - This should make sharing a link to a specific section of the documentation more straight-forward.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Documentation for the following sniffs:
    - Squiz.Classes.ClassFileName
    - Squiz.Classes.ValidClassName
    - Thanks to [Brian Dunne][@braindawg] for the patches.

### Changed
- PHPCBF: the messaging when no fixable errors are found will now distinguish between "No violations" (at all) versus "No fixable errors". [#806]
    - Thanks to [Peter Wilson][@peterwilsoncc] for the patch.
- The `-h` (Help) option now contains a more extensive list of "config" options which can be set. [#809]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Improved error message when invalid sniff codes are supplied to `--sniffs` or `--exclude` command line arguments. [#344]
    - Thanks to [Dan Wallis][@fredden] for the patch.
- Improved error message when an invalid generator name is supplied to the `--generator` command line argument. [#709], [#771]
    - The generator name will now also always be handled case-insensitively, independently of the OS used.
    - Thanks to [Rodrigo Primo][@rodrigoprimo] for the patch.
- The user will be shown an informative error message for sniffs missing one of the required methods. [#873]
    - Previously this would result in a fatal error.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Ruleset processing will now be allowed to run to its conclusion - barring critical errors - before displaying all ruleset errors in one go. [#857]
    - Previously an error in a ruleset would cause PHPCS to exit immediately and show only one error at a time.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Generators: XML documentation files which don't contain any actual documentation will now silently be ignored. [#755]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Generators: when the `title` attribute is missing, the documentation generation will now fall back to the sniff name as the title. [#820]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Generators: cleaner output based on the elements of the documentation which are available. [#819], [#821]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Generators/HTML: improved display of code tables by using semantic HTML. [#854]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Squiz.Classes.ClassFileName: recommend changing the file name instead of changing the class name. [#845]
    - This prevents unactionable recommendations due to the file name not translating to a valid PHP symbol name.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing: incorrect spacing after a comma followed by a promoted property has an improved error message and will now be flagged with the `SpacingBeforePropertyModifier` or `NoSpaceBeforePropertyModifier` error codes. [#792]
    - This was previously already flagged, but using either the `SpacingBeforeHint` or `NoSpaceBeforeHint` error code, which was misleading.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing: the sniff will now also check the spacing after property modifiers for promoted properties in constructor methods. [#792]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.ScopeKeywordSpacing: the sniff will now also check the spacing after the `final` and `abstract` modifier keywords. [#604]
    - Thanks to [Klaus Purer][@klausi] for the patch.
- The following sniff(s) have received efficiency improvements:
    - Squiz.WhiteSpace.ScopeKeywordSpacing
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patches.
- Incorrectly set inline properties (in test case files) will be silently ignored again. [#884]
    - This removes the `Internal.PropertyDoesNotExist` error code.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- The AbstractMethodUnitTest class will now flag duplicate test case markers in a test case file. [#773]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Various housekeeping, including improvements to the tests and documentation.
    - Thanks to [Asis Pattisahusiwa][@asispts], [Dan Wallis][@fredden], [Rodrigo Primo][@rodrigoprimo] and [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for their contributions.

## [3.11.0] - 2024-11-12

### Added
- Runtime support for PHP 8.4. All known PHP 8.4 deprecation notices have been fixed.
    - Syntax support for new PHP 8.4 features will follow in a future release.
    - If you find any PHP 8.4 deprecation notices which were missed, please report them.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patches.
- Tokenizer support for PHP 8.3 "yield from" expressions with a comment between the keywords. [#529], [#647]
    - Sniffs explicitly handling T_YIELD_FROM tokens may need updating. The PR description contains example code for use by sniff developers.
    - Additionally, the following sniff has been updated to support "yield from" expressions with comments:
        - Generic.WhiteSpace.LanguageConstructSpacing
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- New `Generic.WhiteSpace.HereNowdocIdentifierSpacing` sniff. [#586], [#637]
    - Forbid whitespace between the `<<<` and the identifier string in heredoc/nowdoc start tokens.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- New `Generic.Strings.UnnecessaryHeredoc` sniff. [#633]
    - Warns about heredocs without interpolation or expressions in the body text and can auto-fix these to nowdocs.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Documentation for the following sniffs:
    - Generic.Arrays.ArrayIndent
    - Squiz.PHP.Heredoc
    - Thanks to [Rodrigo Primo][@rodrigoprimo] and [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patches.

### Changed
- The Common::getSniffCode() method will now throw an InvalidArgumentException exception if an invalid `$sniffClass` is passed. [#524], [#625]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Documentation generated using the `--generator=...` feature will now always be presented in natural order based on the sniff name(s). [#668]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Minor improvements to the display of runtime information. [#658]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Squiz.Commenting.PostStatementComment: trailing annotations in PHP files will now be reported under a separate, non-auto-fixable error code `AnnotationFound`. [#560], [#627]
    - This prevents (tooling related) annotations from taking on a different meaning when moved by the fixer.
    - The separate error code also allows for selectively excluding it to prevent the sniff from triggering on trailing annotations, while still forbidding other trailing comments.
    - Thanks to [Rodrigo Primo][@rodrigoprimo] for the patch.
- Squiz.ControlStructures.ForEachLoopDeclaration: the `SpacingAfterOpen` error code has been replaced by the `SpaceAfterOpen` error code. The latter is a pre-existing code. The former appears to have been a typo. [#582]
    - Thanks to [Dan Wallis][@fredden] for the patch.
- The following sniff(s) have received efficiency improvements:
    - Generic.Classes.DuplicateClassName
    - Generic.NamingConventions.ConstructorName
    - Thanks to [Rodrigo Primo][@rodrigoprimo] and [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patches.
- Various housekeeping, including improvements to the tests and documentation.
    - Thanks to [Rodrigo Primo][@rodrigoprimo] and [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for their contributions.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#3808][sq-3808] : Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent would throw false positive for tab indented multi-token yield from expression.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

- Support for scanning JavaScript and CSS files. See [#2448][sq-2448].
    - This also means that all sniffs which are only aimed at JavaScript or CSS files are now deprecated.
    - The Javascript and CSS Tokenizers, all Javascript and CSS specific sniffs, and support for JS and CSS in select sniffs which support multiple file types, will be removed in version 4.0.0.
- The abstract `PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\ExactMatch::getBlacklist()` and `PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\ExactMatch::getWhitelist()` methods are deprecated and will be removed in the 4.0 release. See [#198].
    - In version 4.0, these methods will be replaced with abstract `ExactMatch::getDisallowedFiles()` and `ExactMatch::getAllowedFiles()` methods
    - To make Filters extending `ExactMatch` cross-version compatible with both PHP_CodeSniffer 3.9.0+ as well as 4.0+, implement the new `getDisallowedFiles()` and `getAllowedFiles()` methods.
        - When both the `getDisallowedFiles()` and `getAllowedFiles()` methods as well as the `getBlacklist()` and `getWhitelist()` are available, the new methods will take precedence over the old methods.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The MySource standard and all sniffs in it. See [#2471][sq-2471].
    - The MySource standard and all sniffs in it will be removed in version 4.0.0.
- The `Zend.Debug.CodeAnalyzer` sniff. See [#277].
    - This sniff will be removed in version 4.0.0.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

### Fixed

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#307] : PSR2.Classes.ClassDeclaration : space between a modifier keyword and the `class` keyword was not checked when the space included a new line or comment.

## [3.8.0] - 2023-12-08

[Squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) is dead. Long live [PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer)!

### Breaking Changes
- The `squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer` repository has been abandoned. The `PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer` repository will serve as the continuation of the project. For more information about this change, please read the [announcement](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/3932).
    - Installation of PHP_CodeSniffer via PEAR is no longer supported.
        - Users will need to switch to another installation method.
        - Note: this does not affect the PEAR sniffs.
    - For Composer users, nothing changes.
        - **_In contrast to earlier information, the `squizlabs/php_codesniffer` package now points to the new repository and everything will continue to work as before._**
    - PHIVE users may need to clear the PHIVE URL cache.
        - PHIVE users who don't use the package alias, but refer to the package URL, will need to update the URL from `https://squizlabs.github.io/PHP_CodeSniffer/phars/` to `https://phars.phpcodesniffer.com/phars/`.
    - Users who download the PHAR files using curl or wget, will need to update the download URL from `https://squizlabs.github.io/PHP_CodeSniffer/[phpcs|phpcbf].phar` or `https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/releases/latest/download/[phpcs|phpcbf].phar` to `https://phars.phpcodesniffer.com/[phpcs|phpcbf].phar`.
    - For users who install PHP_CodeSniffer via the [Setup-PHP](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/) action runner for GitHub Actions, nothing changes.
    - Users using a git clone will need to update the clone address from `git@github.com:squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer.git` to `git@github.com:PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer.git`.
        - Contributors will need to fork the new repo and add both the new fork as well as the new repo as remotes to their local git copy of PHP_CodeSniffer.
        - Users who have (valid) open issues or pull requests in the `squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer` repository are invited to resubmit these to the `PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer` repository.

### Added

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Added support for PHP 8.2 `true` as a stand-alone type to a number of sniffs
    - Generic.PHP.LowerCaseType
    - PSr12.Functions.NullableTypeDeclaration
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - If any of these tests use the PHPUnit `setUp()`/`tearDown()` methods or overload the `setUp()` in the `AbstractSniffUnitTest` test case, they will need to be adjusted. See the [PR details for further information](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/pull/59/commits/bc302dd977877a22c5e60d42a2f6b7d9e9192dab)
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

### Changed
- Changes have been made to the way PHPCS handles invalid sniff properties being set in a custom ruleset
    - Fixes PHP 8.2 deprecation notices for properties set in a (custom) ruleset for complete standards/complete sniff categories
    - Invalid sniff properties set for individual sniffs will now result in an error and halt the execution of PHPCS
        - A descriptive error message is provided to allow users to fix their ruleset
    - Sniff properties set for complete standards/complete sniff categories will now only be set on sniffs which explicitly support the property
        - The property will be silently ignored for those sniffs which do not support the property
    - Invalid sniff properties set for sniffs via inline annotations will result in an informative `Internal.PropertyDoesNotExist` errror on line 1 of the scanned file, but will not halt the execution of PHPCS
    - For sniff developers, it is strongly recommended for sniffs to explicitly declare any user-adjustable public properties
        - If dynamic properties need to be supported for a sniff, either declare the magic __set()/__get()/__isset()/__unset() methods on the sniff or let the sniff extend stdClass
        - Note: The `#[\AllowDynamicProperties]` attribute will have no effect for properties which are being set in rulesets
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The third parameter for the Ruleset::setSniffProperty() method has been changed to expect an array
    - Sniff developers/integrators of PHPCS may need to make some small adjustments to allow for this change
    - Existing code will continue to work but will throw a deprecation error
    - The backwards compatiblity layer will be removed in PHPCS 4.0
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- When using `auto` report width (the default) a value of 80 columns will be used if the width cannot be determined
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Sniff error messages are now more informative to help bugs get reported to the correct project
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - PSR2 and PSR12 do not have documented rules for this as they pre-date the readonly modifier
    - PSR-PER has been used to confirm the order of this keyword so it can be applied to PSR2 and PSR12 correctly
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PEAR.Commenting.FunctionComment + Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment: the SpacingAfter error can now be auto-fixed
    - Thanks to [Dan Wallis][@fredden] for the patch

### Changed
- The value of the T_FN_ARROW token has changed from "T_FN_ARROW" to "PHPCS_T_FN_ARROW" to avoid package conflicts
    - This will have no impact on custom sniffs unless they are specifically looking at the value of the T_FN_ARROW constant
    - If sniffs are just using constant to find arrow functions, they will continue to work without modification
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- File::findStartOfStatement() now works correctly when passed the last token in a statement
- File::getMethodParameters() now supports PHP 8.0 constructor property promotion
    - Returned method params now include a "property_visibility" and "visibility_token" index if property promotion is detected
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- File::getMethodProperties() now includes a "return_type_end_token" index in the return value
    - This indicates the last token in the return type, which is helpful when checking union types
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Include patterns are now ignored when processing STDIN
    - Previously, checks using include patterns were excluded when processing STDIN when no file path was provided via --stdin-path
    - Now, all include and exclude rules are ignored when no file path is provided, allowing all checks to run
    - If you want include and exclude rules enforced when checking STDIN, use --stdin-path to set the file path
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Spaces are now correctly escaped in the paths to external on Windows
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.UnusedFunctionParameter can now be configured to ignore variable usage for specific type hints
    - This allows you to suppress warnings for some variables that are not required, but leave warnings for others
    - Set the ignoreTypeHints array property to a list of type hints to ignore
    - Thanks to [Petr Bugyík][@o5] for the patch
- Generic.Formatting.MultipleStatementAlignment can now align statements at the start of the assignment token
    - Previously, the sniff enforced that the values were aligned, even if this meant the assignment tokens were not
    - Now, the sniff can enforce that the assignment tokens are aligned, even if this means the values are not
    - Set the "alignAtEnd" sniff property to "false" to align the assignment tokens
    - The default remains at "true", so the assigned values are aligned
    - Thanks to [John P. Bloch][@johnpbloch] for the patch
- Generic.PHP.LowerCaseType now supports checking of typed properties
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.PHP.LowerCaseType now supports checking of union types
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PEAR.Commenting.FunctionComment and Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment sniffs can now ignore private and protected methods
    - Set the "minimumVisibility" sniff property to "protected" to ignore private methods
    - Set the "minimumVisibility" sniff property to "public" to ignore both private and protected methods
    - The default remains at "private", so all methods are checked
    - Thanks to [Vincent Langlet][@VincentLanglet] for the patch
- PEAR.Commenting.FunctionComment and Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment sniffs can now ignore return tags in any method
    - Previously, only `__construct()` and `__destruct()` were ignored
    - Set the list of method names to ignore in the "specialMethods" sniff property
    - The default remains at "__construct" and "__destruct" only
    - Thanks to [Vincent Langlet][@VincentLanglet] for the patch
- PSR2.ControlStructures.SwitchDeclaration now supports nested switch statements where every branch terminates
    - Previously, if a CASE only contained a SWITCH and no direct terminating statement, a fall-through error was displayed
    - Now, the error is suppressed if every branch of the SWITCH has a terminating statement
    - Thanks to [Vincent Langlet][@VincentLanglet] for the patch
- The PSR2.Methods.FunctionCallSignature.SpaceBeforeCloseBracket error message is now reported on the closing parenthesis token
    - Previously, the error was being reported on the function keyword, leading to confusing line numbers in the error report
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment is now able to ignore function comments that are only inheritdoc statements
    - Set the skipIfInheritdoc sniff property to "true" to skip checking function comments if the content is only {@inhertidoc}
    - The default remains at "false", so these comments will continue to report errors
    - Thanks to [Jess Myrbo][@xjm] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment now supports the PHP 8 mixed type
    - Thanks to [Vadim Borodavko][@javer] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.NonExecutableCode now has improved handling of syntax errors
    - Thanks to [Thiemo Kreuz][@thiemowmde] for the patch

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PSR12.ControlStructures.BooleanOperatorPlacement can now be configured to enforce a specific operator position
    - By default, the sniff ensures that operators are all at the beginning or end of lines, but not a mix of both

## [3.5.3] - 2019-12-04

### Changed
- The PHP 7.4 T_FN token has been made available for older versions
    - T_FN represents the fn string used for arrow functions
    - The double arrow becomes the scope opener, and uses a new T_FN_ARROW token type
    - The token after the statement (normally a semicolon) becomes the scope closer
    - The token is also associated with the opening and closing parenthesis of the statement
    - Any functions named "fn" will have a T_FN token for the function name, but have no scope information
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the help with this change
- PHP 7.4 numeric separators are now tokenized in the same way when using older PHP versions
    - Previously, a number like 1_000 would tokenize as T_LNUMBER (1), T_STRING (_000)
    - Now, the number tokenizes as T_LNUMBER (1_000)
    - Sniff developers should consider how numbers with underscores impact their custom sniffs
- The PHPCS file cache now takes file permissions into account
    - The cache is now invalidated for a file when its permissions are changed
- File::getMethodParameters() now supports arrow functions
- File::getMethodProperties() now supports arrow functions
- Added Fixer::changeCodeBlockIndent() to change the indent of a code block while auto-fixing
    - Can be used to either increase or decrease the indent
    - Useful when moving the start position of something like a closure, where you want the content to also move
- Added Generic.Files.ExecutableFile sniff
    - Ensures that files are not executable
    - Thanks to [Matthew Peveler][@MasterOdin] for the contribution
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.EmptyPhpStatement now reports unnecessary semicolons after control structure closing braces
    - Thanks to [Vincent Langlet][@VincentLanglet] for the patch
- Generic.PHP.LowerCaseKeyword now enforces that the "fn" keyword is lowercase
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent now supports static arrow functions
- PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature now adjusts the indent of function argument contents during auto-fixing
    - Previously, only the first line of an argument was changed, leading to inconsistent indents
    - This change also applies to PSR2.Methods.FunctionCallSignature
- PSR2.ControlStructures.ControlStructureSpacing now checks whitespace before the closing parenthesis of multi-line control structures
    - Previously, it incorrectly applied the whitespace check for single-line definitions only
- PSR12.Functions.ReturnTypeDeclaration now checks the return type of arrow functions
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- PSR12.Traits.UseDeclaration now ensures all trait import statements are grouped together
    - Previously, the trait import section of the class ended when the first non-import statement was found
    - Checking now continues throughout the class to ensure all statements are grouped together
    - This also ensures that empty lines are not requested after an import statement that isn't the last one
- Squiz.Functions.LowercaseFunctionKeywords now enforces that the "fn" keyword is lowercase
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#2586][sq-2586] : Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent false positives when indenting open tags at a non tab-stop
- Fixed bug [#2638][sq-2638] : Squiz.CSS.DuplicateClassDefinitionSniff sees comments as part of the class name
    - Thanks to [Raphael Horber][@rhorber] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#2640][sq-2640] : Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing false positives for some negation operators
    - Thanks to [Jakub Chábek][@grongor] and [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#2674][sq-2674] : Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing prints wrong argument name in error message
- Fixed bug [#2676][sq-2676] : PSR12.Files.FileHeader locks up when file ends with multiple inline comments
- Fixed bug [#2678][sq-2678] : PSR12.Classes.AnonClassDeclaration incorrectly enforcing that closing brace be on a line by itself
- Fixed bug [#2685][sq-2685] : File::getMethodParameters() setting typeHintEndToken for vars with no type hint
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#2694][sq-2694] : AbstractArraySniff produces invalid indices when using ternary operator
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#2702][sq-2702] : Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent false positive when using ternary operator with short arrays

    - Provides a clearer error message as whitespace is now visible
    - Also allows for better output for report types such as CSV and XML

- The included PSR12 standard is now complete and ready to use
    - Check your code using PSR-12 by running PHPCS with --standard=PSR12
- Added support for PHP 7.4 typed properties
    - The nullable operator is now tokenized as T_NULLABLE inside property types, as it is elsewhere
    - To get the type of a member var, use the File::getMemberProperties() method, which now contains a "type" array index
        - This contains the type of the member var, or a blank string if not specified
        - If the type is nullable, the return type will contain the leading ?
        - If a type is specified, the position of the first token in the type will be set in a "type_token" array index
        - If a type is specified, the position of the last token in the type will be set in a "type_end_token" array index
        - If the type is nullable, a "nullable_type" array index will also be set to TRUE
        - If the type contains namespace information, it will be cleaned of whitespace and comments in the return value
- The PSR1 standard now correctly bans alternate PHP tags
    - Previously, it only banned short open tags and not the pre-7.0 alternate tags
- Added support for only checking files that have been locally staged in a git repo
    - Use --filter=gitstaged to check these files
    - You still need to give PHPCS a list of files or directories in which to apply the filter
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- JSON reports now end with a newline character
- The phpcs.xsd schema now validates phpcs-only and phpcbf-only attributes correctly

    - If a type hint is specified, the position of the last token in the hint will be set in a "type_hint_end_token" array index
    - If a default is specified, the position of the first token in the default value will be set in a "default_token" array index
    - If a default is specified, the position of the equals sign will be set in a "default_equal_token" array index
    - If the param is not the last, the position of the comma will be set in a "comma_token" array index
    - If the param is passed by reference, the position of the reference operator will be set in a "reference_token" array index
    - If the param is variable length, the position of the variadic operator will be set in a "variadic_token" array index
- The T_LIST token and it's opening and closing parentheses now contain references to each other in the tokens array
    - Uses the same parenthesis_opener/closer/owner indexes as other tokens
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The T_ANON_CLASS token and it's opening and closing parentheses now contain references to each other in the tokens array
    - Uses the same parenthesis_opener/closer/owner indexes as other tokens
    - Only applicable if the anon class is passing arguments to the constructor
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The PHP 7.4 T_BAD_CHARACTER token has been made available for older versions
    - Allows you to safely look for this token, but it will not appear unless checking with PHP 7.4+
- Metrics are now available for Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing
    - Use the "info" report to see blank lines before/after functions
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added PSR12.Classes.AnonClassDeclaration sniff
    - Enforces the formatting of anonymous classes
- Added PSR12.Classes.ClosingBrace sniff
    - Enforces that closing braces of classes/interfaces/traits/functions are not followed by a comment or statement
- Added PSR12.ControlStructures.BooleanOperatorPlacement sniff
    - Enforces that boolean operators between conditions are consistently at the start or end of the line
- Added PSR12.ControlStructures.ControlStructureSpacing sniff
    - Enforces that spacing and indents are correct inside control structure parenthesis

- Added PSR12.Traits.UseDeclaration sniff
    - Enforces the formatting of trait import statements within a class
- Generic.Files.LineLength ignoreComments property now ignores comments at the end of a line
    - Previously, this property was incorrectly causing the sniff to ignore any line that ended with a comment
    - Now, the trailing comment is not included in the line length, but the rest of the line is still checked
- Generic.Files.LineLength now only ignores unwrappable comments when the comment is on a line by itself
    - Previously, a short unwrappable comment at the end of the line would have the sniff ignore the entire line
- Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing no longer checks spacing around assignment operators inside function calls
    - Use the Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing sniff to enforce spacing around assignment operators
        - Note that this sniff checks spacing around all assignment operators, not just inside function calls
    - The Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing.NoSpaceBeforeEquals error has been removed
        - Use Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing.NoSpaceBefore instead
    - The Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing.NoSpaceAfterEquals error has been removed
        - Use Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing.NoSpaceAfter instead
    - This also changes the PEAR/PSR2/PSR12 standards so they no longer check assignment operators inside function calls
        - They were previously checking these operators when they should not have
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent no longer performs exact indents checking for chained method calls
    - Other sniffs can be used to enforce chained method call indent rules
    - Thanks to [Pieter Frenssen][@pfrenssen] for the patch
- PEAR.WhiteSpace.ObjectOperatorIndent now supports multi-level chained statements
    - When enabled, chained calls must be indented 1 level more or less than the previous line
    - Set the new "multilevel" setting to TRUE in a ruleset.xml file to enable this behaviour
    - Thanks to [Marcos Passos][@marcospassos] for the patch
- PSR2.ControlStructures.ControlStructureSpacing now allows whitespace after the opening parenthesis if followed by a comment
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- PSR2.Classes.PropertyDeclaration now enforces a single space after a property type keyword
    - The PSR2 standard itself excludes this new check as it is not defined in the written standard
    - Using the PSR12 standard will enforce this check
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment no longer requires blank line before comment if it's the first content after the PHP open tag
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing now has more accurate error messages
    - This includes renaming the SpaceAfterDefault error code to SpaceAfterEquals, which reflects the real error
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing now checks for no space after a reference operator
    - If you don't want this new behaviour, exclude the SpacingAfterReference error message in a ruleset.xml file
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing now checks for no space after a variadic operator
    - If you don't want this new behaviour, exclude the SpacingAfterVariadic error message in a ruleset.xml file
- Squiz.Functions.MultiLineFunctionDeclaration now has improved fixing for the FirstParamSpacing and UseFirstParamSpacing errors
- Squiz.Operators.IncrementDecrementUsage now suggests pre-increment of variables instead of post-increment
    - This change does not enforce pre-increment over post-increment; only the suggestion has changed
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.DisallowMultipleAssignments now has a second error code for when assignments are found inside control structure conditions
    - The new error code is Squiz.PHP.DisallowMultipleAssignments.FoundInControlStructure
    - All other multiple assignment cases use the existing error code Squiz.PHP.DisallowMultipleAssignments.Found
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing now applies beforeFirst and afterLast spacing rules to nested functions
    - Previously, these rules only applied to the first and last function in a class, interface, or trait
    - These rules now apply to functions nested in any statement block, including other functions and conditions
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing now has improved handling of parse errors
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing now checks spacing around the instanceof operator
    - Thanks to [Jakub Chábek][@grongor] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing can now enforce a single space before assignment operators
    - Previously, the sniff this spacing as multiple assignment operators are sometimes aligned
    - Now, you can set the ignoreSpacingBeforeAssignments sniff property to FALSE to enable checking
    - Default remains TRUE, so spacing before assignments is not checked by default
    - Thanks to [Jakub Chábek][@grongor] for the patch

## [3.4.0] - 2018-12-20

### Deprecated
- The Generic.Formatting.NoSpaceAfterCast sniff has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - The functionality of this sniff is now available in the Generic.Formatting.SpaceAfterCast sniff
        - Include the Generic.Formatting.SpaceAfterCast sniff and set the "spacing" property to "0"
    - As soon as possible, replace all instances of the old sniff code with the new sniff code and property setting
        - The existing sniff will continue to work until version 4 has been released

### Changed
- Rule include patterns in a ruleset.xml file are now evaluated as OR instead of AND
    - Previously, a file had to match every include pattern and no exclude patterns to be included
    - Now, a file must match at least one include pattern and no exclude patterns to be included
    - This is a bug fix as include patterns are already documented to work this way
- New token T_BITWISE_NOT added for the bitwise not operator
    - This token was previously tokenized as T_NONE
    - Any sniffs specifically looking for T_NONE tokens with a tilde as the contents must now also look for T_BITWISE_NOT
    - Sniffs can continue looking for T_NONE as well as T_BITWISE_NOT to support older PHP_CodeSniffer versions
- All types of binary casting are now tokenized as T_BINARY_CAST
    - Previously, the 'b' in 'b"some string with $var"' would be a T_BINARY_CAST, but only when the string contained a var
    - This change ensures the 'b' is always tokenized as T_BINARY_CAST
    - This change also converts '(binary)' from T_STRING_CAST to T_BINARY_CAST
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the help with this patch
- Array properties set inside a ruleset.xml file can now extend a previous value instead of always overwriting it
    - e.g., if you include a ruleset that defines forbidden functions, can you now add to that list instead of having to redefine it
    - To use this feature, add extend="true" to the property tag
        - e.g., property name="forbiddenFunctionNames" type="array" extend="true"
    - Thanks to [Michael Moravec][@Majkl578] for the patch
- If $XDG_CACHE_HOME is set and points to a valid directory, it will be used for caching instead of the system temp directory
- PHPCBF now disables parallel running if you are passing content on STDIN
    - Stops an error from being shown after the fixed output is printed
- The progress report now shows files with tokenizer errors as skipped (S) instead of a warning (W)
    - The tokenizer error is still displayed in reports as normal
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The Squiz standard now ensures there is no space between an increment/decrement operator and its variable
- The File::getMethodProperties() method now includes a has_body array index in the return value
    - FALSE if the method has no body (as with abstract and interface methods) or TRUE otherwise
    - Thanks to [Chris Wilkinson][@thewilkybarkid] for the patch
- The File::getTokensAsString() method now throws an exception if the $start param is invalid
    - If the $length param is invalid, an empty string will be returned
    - Stops an infinite loop when the function is passed invalid data
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Added new Generic.CodeAnalysis.EmptyPHPStatement sniff
    - Warns when it finds empty PHP open/close tag combinations or superfluous semicolons
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added new Generic.Formatting.SpaceBeforeCast sniff
    - Ensures there is exactly 1 space before a type cast, unless the cast statement is indented or multi-line
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added new Generic.VersionControl.GitMergeConflict sniff
    - Detects merge conflict artifacts left in files
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added Generic.WhiteSpace.IncrementDecrementSpacing sniff
    - Ensures there is no space between the operator and the variable it applies to
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added PSR12.Functions.NullableTypeDeclaration sniff
    - Ensures there is no space after the question mark in a nullable type declaration
    - Thanks to [Timo Schinkel][@timoschinkel] for the contribution
- A number of sniffs have improved support for methods in anonymous classes
    - These sniffs would often throw the same error twice for functions in nested classes
    - Error messages have also been changed to be less confusing
    - The full list of affected sniffs is:
        - Generic.NamingConventions.CamelCapsFunctionName
        - PEAR.NamingConventions.ValidFunctionName
        - PSR1.Methods.CamelCapsMethodName
        - PSR2.Methods.MethodDeclaration
        - Squiz.Scope.MethodScope
        - Squiz.Scope.StaticThisUsage
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.UnusedFunctionParameter now only skips functions with empty bodies when the class implements an interface
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.UnusedFunctionParameter now has additional error codes to indicate where unused params were found
    - The new error code prefixes are:
        - FoundInExtendedClass: when the class extends another
        - FoundInImplementedInterface: when the class implements an interface
        - Found: used in all other cases, including closures
    - The new error code suffixes are:
        - BeforeLastUsed: the unused param was positioned before the last used param in the function signature
        - AfterLastUsed: the unused param was positioned after the last used param in the function signature
    - This makes the new error code list for this sniff:
        - Found
        - FoundBeforeLastUsed
        - FoundAfterLastUsed
        - FoundInExtendedClass
        - FoundInExtendedClassBeforeLastUsed
        - FoundInExtendedClassAfterLastUsed
        - FoundInImplementedInterface
        - FoundInImplementedInterfaceBeforeLastUsed
        - FoundInImplementedInterfaceAfterLastUsed
    - These errors code make it easier for specific cases to be ignored or promoted using a ruleset.xml file
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Generic.Classes.DuplicateClassName now inspects traits for duplicate names as well as classes and interfaces

    - Override the "ignoreNewlines" setting in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.Formatting.SpaceAfterNot now has a setting to specify how many spaces are required after a NOT operator
    - Default remains 1
    - Override the "spacing" setting in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.Formatting.SpaceAfterNot now has a setting to ignore newline characters after the NOT operator
    - Default remains FALSE, so newlines are not allowed
    - Override the "ignoreNewlines" setting in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PEAR.Functions.FunctionDeclaration now checks spacing before the opening parenthesis of functions with no body
    - Thanks to [Chris Wilkinson][@thewilkybarkid] for the patch

    - If you are referencing the old error code in a ruleset XML file, please use the new code instead
    - If you wish to maintain backwards compatibility, you can provide rules for both the old and new codes
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

## [3.3.1] - 2018-07-27

### Removed
- Support for HHVM has been dropped due to recent unfixed bugs and HHVM refocus on Hack only
    - Thanks to [Walt Sorensen][@photodude] and [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for helping to remove all HHVM exceptions from the core

### Changed
- The full report (the default report) now has improved word wrapping for multi-line messages and sniff codes
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The summary report now sorts files based on their directory location instead of just a basic string sort
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The source report now orders error codes by name when they have the same number of errors
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The junit report no longer generates validation errors with the Jenkins xUnit plugin
    - Thanks to [Nikolay Geo][@nicholascus] for the patch
- Generic.Commenting.DocComment no longer generates the SpacingBeforeTags error if tags are the first content in the docblock
    - The sniff will still generate a MissingShort error if there is no short comment
    - This allows the MissingShort error to be suppressed in a ruleset to make short descriptions optional
- Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing now properly fixes multi-line function calls with leading commas
    - Previously, newlines between function arguments would be removed
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.PHP.Syntax will now use PHP_BINARY instead of trying to discover the executable path
    - This ensures that the sniff will always syntax check files using the PHP version that PHPCS is running under
    - Setting the `php_path` config var will still override this value as normal
    - Thanks to [Willem Stuursma-Ruwen][@willemstuursma] for the patch
- PSR2.Namespaces.UseDeclaration now supports commas at the end of group use declarations
    - Also improves checking and fixing for use statements containing parse errors
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration no longer removes the array opening brace while fixing
    - This could occur when the opening brace was on a new line and the first array key directly followed
    - This change also stops the KeyNotAligned error message being incorrectly reported in these cases
- Squiz.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration no longer tries to change multi-line arrays to single line when they contain comments
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and some indentation sniffs
- Squiz.Classes.ClassDeclaration no longer enforces spacing rules when a class is followed by a function
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing sniff
- The Squiz.Classes.ValidClassName.NotCamelCaps message now references PascalCase instead of CamelCase
    - The "CamelCase class name" metric produced by the sniff has been changed to "PascalCase class name"
    - This reflects the fact that the class name check is actually a Pascal Case check and not really Camel Case
    - Thanks to [Tom H Anderson][@TomHAnderson] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment no longer enforces spacing rules when an inline comment is followed by a docblock
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing sniff
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing no longer tries to fix operator spacing if the next content is a comment on a new line
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.Commenting.PostStatementComment sniff
    - Also stops PHPCS annotations from being moved to a different line, potentially changing their meaning
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing no longer checks spacing of functions at the top of an embedded PHP block
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.PHP.EmbeddedPHP sniff
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.MemberVarSpacing no longer checks spacing before member vars that come directly after methods
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing sniff
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.SuperfluousWhitespace now recognizes unicode whitespace at the start and end of a file
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

### Fixed

- Fixed bug [#2053][sq-2053] : PSR12.Classes.ClassInstantiation incorrectly fix when using member vars and some variable formats
- Fixed bug [#2065][sq-2065] : Generic.ControlStructures.InlineControlStructure fixing fails when inline control structure contains closure
- Fixed bug [#2072][sq-2072] : Squiz.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration throws NoComma error when array value is a shorthand IF statement

## [3.3.0] - 2018-06-07

### Deprecated
- The Squiz.WhiteSpace.LanguageConstructSpacing sniff has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - The sniff has been moved to the Generic standard, with a new code of Generic.WhiteSpace.LanguageConstructSpacing
    - As soon as possible, replace all instances of the old sniff code with the new sniff code in your ruleset.xml files
        - The existing Squiz sniff will continue to work until version 4 has been released
    - The new Generic sniff now also checks many more language constructs to enforce additional spacing rules
        - Thanks to [Mponos George][@gmponos] for the contribution
- The current method for setting array properties in ruleset files has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - Currently, setting an array value uses the string syntax "print=>echo,create_function=>null"
    - Now, individual array elements are specified using a new "element" tag with "key" and "value" attributes
        - For example, element key="print" value="echo"
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- The T_ARRAY_HINT token has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - The token was used to ensure array type hints were not tokenized as T_ARRAY, but no other type hints were given a special token
    - Array type hints now use the standard T_STRING token instead
    - Sniffs referencing this token type will continue to run without error until version 4, but will not find any T_ARRAY_HINT tokens
- The T_RETURN_TYPE token has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - The token was used to ensure array/self/parent/callable return types were tokenized consistently
    - For namespaced return types, only the last part of the string (the class name) was tokenized as T_RETURN_TYPE
    - This was not consistent and so return types are now left using their original token types so they are not skipped by sniffs
        - The exception are array return types, which are tokenized as T_STRING instead of T_ARRAY, as they are for type hints
    - Sniffs referencing this token type will continue to run without error until version 4, but will not find any T_RETUTN_TYPE tokens
    - To get the return type of a function, use the File::getMethodProperties() method, which now contains a "return_type" array index
        - This contains the return type of the function or closer, or a blank string if not specified
        - If the return type is nullable, the return type will contain the leading ?
            - A nullable_return_type array index in the return value will also be set to true
        - If the return type contains namespace information, it will be cleaned of whitespace and comments
            - To access the original return value string, use the main tokens array

### Added
- This release contains an incomplete version of the PSR-12 coding standard
    - Errors found using this standard should be valid, but it will miss a lot of violations until it is complete
    - If you'd like to test and help, you can use the standard by running PHPCS with --standard=PSR12

### Changed
- Config values set using --runtime-set now override any config values set in rulesets or the CodeSniffer.conf file
- You can now apply include-pattern rules to individual message codes in a ruleset like you can with exclude-pattern rules
    - Previously, include-pattern rules only applied to entire sniffs
    - If a message code has both include and exclude patterns, the exclude patterns will be ignored
- Using PHPCS annotations to selectively re-enable sniffs is now more flexible
    - Previously, you could only re-enable a sniff/category/standard using the exact same code that was disabled
    - Now, you can disable a standard and only re-enable a specific category or sniff
    - Or, you can disable a specific sniff and have it re-enable when you re-enable the category or standard
- The value of array sniff properties can now be set using phpcs:set annotations
    - e.g., phpcs:set Standard.Category.SniffName property[] key=>value,key2=>value2
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- PHPCS annotations now remain as T_PHPCS_* tokens instead of reverting to comment tokens when --ignore-annotations is used
    - This stops sniffs (especially commenting sniffs) from generating a large number of false errors when ignoring
    - Any custom sniffs that are using the T_PHPCS_* tokens to detect annotations may need to be changed to ignore them
        - Check $phpcsFile->config->annotations to see if annotations are enabled and ignore when false
- You can now use fully or partially qualified class names for custom reports instead of absolute file paths
    - To support this, you must specify an autoload file in your ruleset.xml file and use it to register an autoloader
    - Your autoloader will need to load your custom report class when requested
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The JSON report format now does escaping in error source codes as well as error messages
    - Thanks to [Martin Vasel][@marvasDE] for the patch
- Invalid installed_paths values are now ignored instead of causing a fatal error
- Improved testability of custom rulesets by allowing the installed standards to be overridden
    - Thanks to [Timo Schinkel][@timoschinkel] for the patch
- The key used for caching PHPCS runs now includes all set config values
    - This fixes a problem where changing config values (e.g., via --runtime-set) used an incorrect cache file
- The "Function opening brace placement" metric has been separated into function and closure metrics in the info report
    - Closures are no longer included in the "Function opening brace placement" metric
    - A new "Closure opening brace placement" metric now shows information for closures
- Multi-line T_YIELD_FROM statements are now replicated properly for older PHP versions
- The PSR2 standard no longer produces 2 error messages when the AS keyword in a foreach loop is not lowercase
- Specifying a path to a non-existent dir when using the `--report-[reportType]=/path/to/report` CLI option no longer throws an exception
    - This now prints a readable error message, as it does when using `--report-file`
- The File::getMethodParamaters() method now includes a type_hint_token array index in the return value
    - Provides the position in the token stack of the first token in the type hint
- The File::getMethodProperties() method now includes a return_type_token array index in the return value
    - Provides the position in the token stack of the first token in the return type
- The File::getTokensAsString() method can now optionally return original (non tab-replaced) content
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Removed Squiz.PHP.DisallowObEndFlush from the Squiz standard
    - If you use this sniff and want to continue banning ob_end_flush(), use Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions instead
    - You will need to set the forbiddenFunctions property in your ruleset.xml file
- Removed Squiz.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions from the Squiz standard
    - Replaced by using the forbiddenFunctions property of Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions in the Squiz ruleset.xml
    - Functionality of the Squiz standard remains the same, but the error codes are now different
    - Previously, Squiz.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions.Found and Squiz.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions.FoundWithAlternative
    - Now, Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions.Found and Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions.FoundWithAlternative
- Added new Generic.PHP.LowerCaseType sniff
    - Ensures PHP types used for type hints, return types, and type casting are lowercase
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added new Generic.WhiteSpace.ArbitraryParenthesesSpacing sniff
    - Generates an error for whitespace inside parenthesis that don't belong to a function call/declaration or control structure
    - Generates a warning for any empty parenthesis found
    - Allows the required spacing to be set using the spacing sniff property (default is 0)
    - Allows newlines to be used by setting the ignoreNewlines sniff property (default is false)
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added new PSR12.Classes.ClassInstantiation sniff
    - Ensures parenthesis are used when instantiating a new class
- Added new PSR12.Keywords.ShortFormTypeKeywords sniff
    - Ensures the short form of PHP types is used when type casting
- Added new PSR12.Namespaces.CompundNamespaceDepth sniff
    - Ensures compound namespace use statements have a max depth of 2 levels
    - The max depth can be changed by setting the 'maxDepth' sniff property in a ruleset.xml file
- Added new PSR12.Operators.OperatorSpacing sniff
    - Ensures operators are preceded and followed by at least 1 space
- Improved core support for grouped property declarations
    - Also improves support in Squiz.WhiteSpace.ScopeKeywordSpacing and Squiz.WhiteSpace.MemberVarSpacing
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.Commenting.DocComment now produces a NonParamGroup error when tags are mixed in with the @param tag group
    - It would previously throw either a NonParamGroup or ParamGroup error depending on the order of tags
    - This change allows the NonParamGroup error to be suppressed in a ruleset to allow the @param group to contain other tags
    - Thanks to [Phil Davis][@phil-davis] for the patch
- Generic.Commenting.DocComment now continues checks param tags even if the doc comment short description is missing
    - This change allows the MissingShort error to be suppressed in a ruleset without all other errors being suppressed as well
    - Thanks to [Phil Davis][@phil-davis] for the patch
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.AssignmentInCondition now reports a different error code for assignments found in WHILE conditions
    - The return value of a function call is often assigned in a WHILE condition, so this change makes it easier to exclude these cases
    - The new code for this error message is Generic.CodeAnalysis.AssignmentInCondition.FoundInWhileCondition
    - The error code for all other cases remains as Generic.CodeAnalysis.AssignmentInCondition.Found
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.Functions.OpeningFunctionBraceBsdAllman now longer leaves trailing whitespace when moving the opening brace during fixing
    - Also applies to fixes made by PEAR.Functions.FunctionDeclaration and Squiz.Functions.MultiLineFunctionDeclaration
- Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent now does a better job of fixing the indent of multi-line comments
- Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent now does a better job of fixing the indent of PHP open and close tags
- PEAR.Commenting.FunctionComment now report a different error code for param comment lines with too much padding
    - Previously, any lines of a param comment that don't start at the exact comment position got the same error code
    - Now, only comment lines with too little padding use ParamCommentAlignment as they are clearly mistakes
    - Comment lines with too much padding may be using precision alignment as now use ParamCommentAlignmentExceeded
    - This allows for excessive padding to be excluded from a ruleset while continuing to enforce a minimum padding
- PEAR.WhiteSpace.ObjectOperatorIndent now checks the indent of more chained operators
    - Previously, it only checked chains beginning with a variable
    - Now, it checks chains beginning with function calls, static class names, etc
- Squiz.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration now continues checking array formatting even if the key indent is not correct
    - Allows for using different array indent rules while still checking/fixing double arrow and value alignment
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment has improved support for tab-indented comments
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment auto fixing no longer breaks when two block comments follow each other
    - Also stopped single-line block comments from being auto fixed when they are embedded in other code
    - Also fixed as issue found when PHPCS annotations were used inside a block comment
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment.LastLineIndent is now able to be fixed with phpcbf
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment now aligns star-prefixed lines under the opening tag while fixing, instead of indenting them
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment.IncorrectTypeHint message no longer contains cut-off suggested type hints
- Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment now uses a new error code for inline comments at the end of a function
    - Previously, all inline comments followed by a blank line threw a Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment.SpacingAfter error
    - Now, inline comments at the end of a function will instead throw Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment.SpacingAfterAtFunctionEnd
    - If you previously excluded SpacingAfter, add an exclusion for SpacingAfterAtFunctionEnd to your ruleset as well
    - If you previously only included SpacingAfter, consider including SpacingAfterAtFunctionEnd as well
    - The Squiz standard now excludes SpacingAfterAtFunctionEnd as the blank line is checked elsewhere
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.ControlStructures.ControlSignature now errors when a comment follows the closing brace of an earlier body
    - Applies to catch, finally, else, elseif, and do/while structures
    - The included PSR2 standard now enforces this rule
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Formatting.OperatorBracket.MissingBrackets message has been changed to remove the word "arithmetic"
    - The sniff checks more than just arithmetic operators, so the message is now clearer
- Sniffs.Operators.ComparisonOperatorUsage now detects more cases of implicit true comparisons
    - It could previously be confused by comparisons used as function arguments
- Squiz.PHP.CommentedOutCode now ignores simple @-style annotation comments so they are not flagged as commented out code
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.CommentedOutCode now ignores a greater number of short comments so they are not flagged as commented out code
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.DisallowComparisonAssignment no longer errors when using the null coalescing operator
    - Given this operator is used almost exclusively to assign values, it didn't make sense to generate an error
- Squiz.WhiteSpacing.FunctionSpacing now has a property to specify how many blank lines should be before the first class method
    - Only applies when a method is the first code block in a class (i.e., there are no member vars before it)
    - Override the 'spacingBeforeFirst' property in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - If not set, the sniff will use whatever value is set for the existing 'spacing' property
- Squiz.WhiteSpacing.FunctionSpacing now has a property to specify how many blank lines should be after the last class method
    - Only applies when a method is the last code block in a class (i.e., there are no member vars after it)
    - Override the 'spacingAfterLast' property in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - If not set, the sniff will use whatever value is set for the existing 'spacing' property

## [3.2.0] - 2017-12-13

### Deprecated
- This release deprecates the @codingStandards comment syntax used for sending commands to PHP_CodeSniffer
    - The existing syntax will continue to work in all version 3 releases, but will be removed in version 4
    - The comment formats have been replaced by a shorter syntax:
        - @codingStandardsIgnoreFile becomes phpcs:ignoreFile
        - @codingStandardsIgnoreStart becomes phpcs:disable
        - @codingStandardsIgnoreEnd becomes phpcs:enable
        - @codingStandardsIgnoreLine becomes phpcs:ignore
        - @codingStandardsChangeSetting becomes phpcs:set
    - The new syntax allows for additional developer comments to be added after a -- separator
        - This is useful for describing why a code block is being ignored, or why a setting is being changed
        - E.g., phpcs:disable -- This code block must be left as-is.
    - Comments using the new syntax are assigned new comment token types to allow them to be detected:
        - phpcs:ignoreFile has the token T_PHPCS_IGNORE_FILE
        - phpcs:disable has the token T_PHPCS_DISABLE
        - phpcs:enable has the token T_PHPCS_ENABLE
        - phpcs:ignore has the token T_PHPCS_IGNORE
        - phpcs:set has the token T_PHPCS_SET

### Changed
- The phpcs:disable and phpcs:ignore comments can now selectively ignore specific sniffs (request [#604][sq-604])
    - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic.Commenting.Todo.Found for a specific message
    - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic.Commenting.Todo for a whole sniff
    - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic.Commenting for a whole category of sniffs
    - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic for a whole standard
    - Multiple sniff codes can be specified by comma separating them
        - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic.Commenting.Todo,PSR1.Files
- @codingStandardsIgnoreLine comments now only ignore the following line if they are on a line by themselves
    - If they are at the end of an existing line, they will only ignore the line they are on
    - Stops some lines from accidentally being ignored
    - Same rule applies for the new phpcs:ignore comment syntax
- PSR1.Files.SideEffects now respects the new phpcs:disable comment syntax
    - The sniff will no longer check any code that is between phpcs:disable and phpcs:enable comments
    - The sniff does not support phpcs:ignore; you must wrap code structures with disable/enable comments
    - Previously, there was no way to have this sniff ignore parts of a file
- Fixed a problem where PHPCS would sometimes hang waiting for STDIN, or read incomplete versions of large files
    - Thanks to [Arne Jørgensen][@arnested] for the patch
- Array properties specified in ruleset files now have their keys and values trimmed
    - This saves having to do this in individual sniffs and stops errors introduced by whitespace in rulesets
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Added phpcs.xsd to allow validation of ruleset XML files
    - Thanks to [Renaat De Muynck][@renaatdemuynck] for the contribution
- File paths specified using --stdin-path can now point to fake file locations (request [#1488][sq-1488])
    - Previously, STDIN files using fake file paths were excluded from checking
- Setting an empty basepath (--basepath=) on the CLI will now clear a basepath set directly in a ruleset
    - Thanks to [Xaver Loppenstedt][@xalopp] for the patch
- Ignore patterns are now checked on symlink target paths instead of symlink source paths
    - Restores previous behaviour of this feature
- Metrics were being double counted when multiple sniffs were recording the same metric
- Added support for bash process substitution
    - Thanks to [Scott Dutton][@exussum12] for the contribution
- Files included in the cache file code hash are now sorted to aid in cache file reuse across servers
- Windows BAT files can now be used outside a PEAR install
    - You must have the path to PHP set in your PATH environment variable
    - Thanks to [Joris Debonnet][@JorisDebonnet] for the patch
- The JS unsigned right shift assignment operator is now properly classified as an assignment operator
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The AbstractVariableSniff abstract sniff now supports anonymous classes and nested functions
    - Also fixes an issue with Squiz.Scope.MemberVarScope where member vars of anonymous classes were not being checked
- Added AbstractArraySniff to make it easier to create sniffs that check array formatting
    - Allows for checking of single and multi line arrays easily
    - Provides a parsed structure of the array including positions of keys, values, and double arrows
- Added Generic.Arrays.ArrayIndent to enforce a single tab stop indent for array keys in multi-line arrays
    - Also ensures the close brace is on a new line and indented to the same level as the original statement
    - Allows for the indent size to be set using an "indent" property of the sniff
- Added Generic.PHP.DiscourageGoto to warn about the use of the GOTO language construct
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.WhiteSpace.DisallowTabIndent now fixes tab indents in multi-line block comments
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PEAR.Functions.FunctionDeclaration no longer errors when a function declaration is the first content in a JS file
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature now requires the function name to be indented to an exact tab stop
    - If the function name is not the start of the statement, the opening statement must be indented correctly instead
    - Added a new fixable error code PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature.OpeningIndent for this error
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing is no longer confused about comments in function declarations
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.NonExecutableCode error messages now indicate which line the code block ending is on
    - Makes it easier to identify where the code block exited or returned
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment now supports nullable type hints
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionCommentThrowTag no longer assigns throw tags inside anon classes to the enclosing function

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.ControlStructures.ControlSignature now allows configuring the number of spaces before the colon in alternative syntax
    - Override the 'requiredSpacesBeforeColon' setting in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - Default remains at 1
    - Thanks to [Nikola Kovacs][@nkovacs] for the patch
- The Squiz standard now ensures array keys are indented 4 spaces from the main statement
    - Previously, this standard aligned keys 1 space from the start of the array keyword
- The Squiz standard now ensures array end braces are aligned with the main statement
    - Previously, this standard aligned the close brace with the start of the array keyword
- The standard for PHP_CodeSniffer itself now enforces short array syntax
- The standard for PHP_CodeSniffer itself now uses the Generic.Arrays/ArrayIndent sniff rules
- Improved fixer conflicts and syntax error handling for a number of sniffs

    - The custom PHP_CodeSniffer test runner now requires a bootstrap file
    - Developers with custom standards using the PHP_CodeSniffer test runner will need to do one of the following:
        - run your unit tests from the PHP_CodeSniffer root dir so the bootstrap file is included
        - specify the PHP_CodeSniffer bootstrap file on the command line: `phpunit --bootstrap=/path/to/phpcs/tests/bootstrap.php`
        - require the PHP_CodeSniffer bootstrap file from your own bootstrap file
    - If you don't run PHP_CodeSniffer unit tests, this change will not affect you
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- A phpcs.xml or phpcs.xml.dist file now takes precedence over the default_standard config setting
    - Thanks to [Björn Fischer][@Fischer-Bjoern] for the patch
- Both phpcs.xml and phpcs.xml.dist files can now be prefixed with a dot (request [#1566][sq-1566])
    - The order that the files are searched is: .phpcs.xml, .phpcs.xml.dist, phpcs.xml, phpcs.xml.dist
- The autoloader will now search for files during unit tests runs from the same locations as during normal phpcs runs
    - Allows for easier unit testing of custom standards that use helper classes or custom namespaces
- Include patterns for sniffs now use OR logic instead of AND logic
    - Previously, a file had to be in each of the include patterns to be processed by a sniff
    - Now, a file has to only be in at least one of the patterns
    - This change reflects the original intention of the feature
- PHPCS will now follow symlinks under the list of checked directories
    - This previously only worked if you specified the path to a symlink on the command line
- Output from --config-show, --config-set, and --config-delete now includes the path to the loaded config file
- PHPCS now cleanly exits if its config file is not readable
    - Previously, a combination of PHP notices and PHPCS errors would be generated
- Comment tokens that start with /** are now always tokenized as docblocks
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- The PHP-supplied T_YIELD and T_YIELD_FROM token have been replicated for older PHP versions
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Added new Generic.CodeAnalysis.AssignmentInCondition sniff to warn about variable assignments inside conditions
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added Generic.Files.OneObjectStructurePerFile sniff to ensure there is a single class/interface/trait per file
    - Thanks to [Mponos George][@gmponos] for the contribution
- Function call sniffs now check variable function names and self/static object creation
    - Specific sniffs are Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing, PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature, and PSR2.Methods.FunctionCallSignature
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Generic.Files.LineLength can now be configured to ignore all comment lines, no matter their length
    - Set the ignoreComments property to TRUE (default is FALSE) in your ruleset.xml file to enable this
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.PHP.LowerCaseKeyword now checks self, parent, yield, yield from, and closure (function) keywords
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- PEAR.Functions.FunctionDeclaration now removes a blank line if it creates one by moving the curly brace during fixing
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionCommentThrowTag now supports PHP 7.1 multi catch exceptions
- Squiz.Formatting.OperatorBracket no longer throws errors for PHP 7.1 multi catch exceptions
- Squiz.Commenting.LongConditionClosingComment now supports finally statements
- Squiz.Formatting.OperatorBracket now correctly fixes pipe separated flags
- Squiz.Formatting.OperatorBracket now correctly fixes statements containing short array syntax
- Squiz.PHP.EmbeddedPhp now properly fixes cases where the only content in an embedded PHP block is a comment
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.ControlStructureSpacing now ignores comments when checking blank lines at the top of control structures
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.ObjectOperatorSpacing now detects and fixes spaces around double colons
    - Thanks to [Julius Šmatavičius][@bondas83] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.MemberVarSpacing can now be configured to check any number of blank lines between member vars
    - Set the spacing property (default is 1) in your ruleset.xml file to set the spacing
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.MemberVarSpacing can now be configured to check a different number of blank lines before the first member var
    - Set the spacingBeforeFirst property (default is 1) in your ruleset.xml file to set the spacing
- Added a new PHP_CodeSniffer\Util\Tokens::$ooScopeTokens static member var for quickly checking object scope
    - Includes T_CLASS, T_ANON_CLASS, T_INTERFACE, and T_TRAIT
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PHP_CodeSniffer\Files\File::findExtendedClassName() now supports extended interfaces
    - Thanks to [Martin Hujer][@mhujer] for the patch

## [3.0.2] - 2017-07-18

### Changed
- The code report now gracefully handles tokenizer exceptions
- The phpcs and phpcbf scripts are now the only places that exit() in the code
    - This allows for easier usage of core PHPCS functions from external scripts
    - If you are calling Runner::runPHPCS() or Runner::runPHPCBF() directly, you will get back the full range of exit codes
    - If not, catch the new DeepExitException to get the error message ($e->getMessage()) and exit code ($e->getCode());
- NOWDOC tokens are now considered conditions, just as HEREDOC tokens are
    - This makes it easier to find the start and end of a NOWDOC from any token within it
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Custom autoloaders are now only included once in case multiple standards are using the same one
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Improved tokenizing of fallthrough CASE and DEFAULT statements that share a closing statement and use curly braces
- Improved the error message when Squiz.ControlStructures.ControlSignature detects a newline after the closing parenthesis

### Fixed
- Fixed a problem where the source report was not printing the correct number of errors found
- Fixed a problem where the --cache=/path/to/cachefile CLI argument was not working
- Fixed bug [#1465][sq-1465] : Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent reports incorrect errors when indenting double arrows in short arrays
- Fixed bug [#1478][sq-1478] : Indentation in fallthrough CASE that contains a closure
- Fixed bug [#1497][sq-1497] : Fatal error if composer prepend-autoloader is set to false
    - Thanks to [Kunal Mehta][@legoktm] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1503][sq-1503] : Alternative control structure syntax not always recognized as scoped
- Fixed bug [#1523][sq-1523] : Fatal error when using the --suffix argument
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1526][sq-1526] : Use of basepath setting can stop PHPCBF being able to write fixed files
- Fixed bug [#1530][sq-1530] : Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent can increase indent too much for lines within code blocks
- Fixed bug [#1547][sq-1547] : Wrong token type for backslash in use function
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1549][sq-1549] : Squiz.PHP.EmbeddedPhp fixer conflict with // comment before PHP close tag
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

## [3.0.1] - 2017-06-14

### Security
- This release contains a fix for a security advisory related to the improper handling of a shell command
    - A properly crafted filename would allow for arbitrary code execution when using the --filter=gitmodified command line option
    - All version 3 users are encouraged to upgrade to this version, especially if you are checking 3rd-party code
        - e.g., you run PHPCS over libraries that you did not write
        - e.g., you provide a web service that runs PHPCS over user-uploaded files or 3rd-party repositories
        - e.g., you allow external tool paths to be set by user-defined values
    - If you are unable to upgrade but you check 3rd-party code, ensure you are not using the Git modified filter
    - This advisory does not affect PHP_CodeSniffer version 2.
    - Thanks to [Sergei Morozov][@morozov] for the report and patch

### Changed
- Arguments on the command line now override or merge with those specified in a ruleset.xml file in all cases
- PHPCS now stops looking for a phpcs.xml file as soon as one is found, favoring the closest one to the current dir
- Added missing help text for the --stdin-path CLI option to --help
- Re-added missing help text for the --file-list and --bootstrap CLI options to --help
- Runner::runPHPCS() and Runner::runPHPCBF() now return an exit code instead of exiting directly (request [#1484][sq-1484])
- The Squiz standard now enforces short array syntax by default
- The autoloader is now working correctly with classes created with class_alias()
- The autoloader will now search for files inside all directories in the installed_paths config var
    - This allows autoloading of files inside included custom coding standards without manually requiring them
- You can now specify a namespace for a custom coding standard, used by the autoloader to load non-sniff helper files
    - Also used by the autoloader to help other standards directly include sniffs for your standard
    - Set the value to the namespace prefix you are using for sniff files (everything up to \Sniffs\)
    - e.g., if your namespace format is MyProject\CS\Standard\Sniffs\Category set the namespace to MyProject\CS\Standard
    - If omitted, the namespace is assumed to be the same as the directory name containing the ruleset.xml file
    - The namespace is set in the ruleset tag of the ruleset.xml file
    - e.g., ruleset name="My Coding Standard" namespace="MyProject\CS\Standard"
- Rulesets can now specify custom autoloaders using the new autoload tag
    - Autoloaders are included while the ruleset is being processed and before any custom sniffs are included
    - Allows for very custom autoloading of helper classes well before the boostrap files are included
- The PEAR standard now includes Squiz.Commenting.DocCommentAlignment
    - It previously broke comments onto multiple lines, but didn't align them

### Fixed
- Fixed a problem where excluding a message from a custom standard's own sniff would exclude the whole sniff
    - This caused some PSR2 errors to be under-reported
- Fixed bug [#1442][sq-1442] : T_NULLABLE detection not working for nullable parameters and return type hints in some cases
- Fixed bug [#1447][sq-1447] : Running the unit tests with a PHPUnit config file breaks the test suite
    - Unknown arguments were not being handled correctly, but are now stored in $config->unknown
- Fixed bug [#1449][sq-1449] : Generic.Classes.OpeningBraceSameLine doesn't detect comment before opening brace
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1450][sq-1450] : Coding standard located under an installed_path with the same directory name throws an error
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1451][sq-1451] : Sniff exclusions/restrictions don't work with custom sniffs unless they use the PHP_CodeSniffer NS
- Fixed bug [#1454][sq-1454] : Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing is not checking spacing on either side of a short ternary operator
    - Thanks to [Mponos George][@gmponos] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1495][sq-1495] : Setting an invalid installed path breaks all commands
- Fixed bug [#1496][sq-1496] : Squiz.Strings.DoubleQuoteUsage not unescaping dollar sign when fixing
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1501][sq-1501] : Interactive mode is broken
- Fixed bug [#1504][sq-1504] : PSR2.Namespaces.UseDeclaration hangs fixing use statement with no trailing code

## [3.0.0] - 2017-05-04

### Changed
- Added an --ignore-annotations command line argument to ignore all @codingStandards annotations in code comments (request [#811][sq-811])
- This allows you to force errors to be shown that would otherwise be ignored by code comments
    - Also stop files being able to change sniff properties midway through processing
- An error is now reported if no sniffs were registered to be run (request [#1129][sq-1129])
- The autoloader will now search for files inside the directory of any loaded coding standard
    - This allows autoloading of any file inside a custom coding standard without manually requiring them
    - Ensure your namespace begins with your coding standard's directory name and follows PSR-4
    - e.g., StandardName\Sniffs\CategoryName\AbstractHelper or StandardName\Helpers\StringSniffHelper
- Fixed an error where STDIN was sometimes not checked when using the --parallel CLI option
- The is_closure index has been removed from the return value of File::getMethodProperties()
    - This value was always false because T_FUNCTION tokens are never closures
    - Closures have a token type of T_CLOSURE
- The File::isAnonymousFunction() method has been removed
    - This function always returned false because it only accepted T_FUNCTION tokens, which are never closures
    - Closures have a token type of T_CLOSURE
- Includes all changes from the 2.9.0 release

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#834][sq-834] : PSR2.ControlStructures.SwitchDeclaration does not handle if branches with returns
    - Thanks to [Fabian Wiget][@fabacino] for the patch

## [3.0.0RC4] - 2017-03-02

### Security
- This release contains a fix for a security advisory related to the improper handling of shell commands
    - Uses of shell_exec() and exec() were not escaping filenames and configuration settings in most cases
    - A properly crafted filename or configuration option would allow for arbitrary code execution when using some features
    - All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version, especially if you are checking 3rd-party code
        - e.g., you run PHPCS over libraries that you did not write
        - e.g., you provide a web service that runs PHPCS over user-uploaded files or 3rd-party repositories
        - e.g., you allow external tool paths to be set by user-defined values
    - If you are unable to upgrade but you check 3rd-party code, ensure you are not using the following features:
        - The diff report
        - The notify-send report
        - The Generic.PHP.Syntax sniff
        - The Generic.Debug.CSSLint sniff
        - The Generic.Debug.ClosureLinter sniff
        - The Generic.Debug.JSHint sniff
        - The Squiz.Debug.JSLint sniff
        - The Squiz.Debug.JavaScriptLint sniff
        - The Zend.Debug.CodeAnalyzer sniff
    - Thanks to [Klaus Purer][@klausi] for the report

### Changed
- The indent property of PEAR.Classes.ClassDeclaration has been removed
    - Instead of calculating the indent of the brace, it just ensures the brace is aligned with the class keyword
    - Other sniffs can be used to ensure the class itself is indented correctly
- Invalid exclude rules inside a ruleset.xml file are now ignored instead of potentially causing out of memory errors
    - Using the -vv command line argument now also shows the invalid exclude rule as XML
- Includes all changes from the 2.8.1 release

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#1333][sq-1333] : The new autoloader breaks some frameworks with custom autoloaders
- Fixed bug [#1334][sq-1334] : Undefined offset when explaining standard with custom sniffs

[sq-1334]: https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/1334

## [3.0.0RC3] - 2017-02-02

### Changed
- Added support for ES6 class declarations
    - Previously, these class were tokenized as JS objects but are now tokenized as normal T_CLASS structures
- Added support for ES6 method declarations, where the "function" keyword is not used
    - Previously, these methods were tokenized as JS objects (fixes bug [#1251][sq-1251])
    - The name of the ES6 method is now assigned the T_FUNCTION keyword and treated like a normal function
    - Custom sniffs that support JS and listen for T_FUNCTION tokens can't assume the token represents the word "function"
    - Check the contents of the token first, or use $phpcsFile->getDeclarationName($stackPtr) if you just want its name
    - There is no change for custom sniffs that only check PHP code
- PHPCBF exit codes have been changed so they are now more useful (request [#1270][sq-1270])
    - Exit code 0 is now used to indicate that no fixable errors were found, and so nothing was fixed
    - Exit code 1 is now used to indicate that all fixable errors were fixed correctly
    - Exit code 2 is now used to indicate that PHPCBF failed to fix some of the fixable errors it found
    - Exit code 3 is now used for general script execution errors
- Added PEAR.Commenting.FileComment.ParamCommentAlignment to check alignment of multi-line param comments
- Includes all changes from the 2.8.0 release

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where excluding a file using a @codingStandardsIgnoreFile comment would produce errors
    - For PHPCS, it would show empty files being processed
    - For PHPCBF, it would produce a PHP error
- Fixed bug [#1233][sq-1233] : Can't set config data inside ruleset.xml file
- Fixed bug [#1241][sq-1241] : CodeSniffer.conf not working with 3.x PHAR file

## [3.0.0RC2] - 2016-11-30

### Changed
- Made the Runner class easier to use with wrapper scripts
- Full usage information is no longer printed when a usage error is encountered (request [#1186][sq-1186])
    - Makes it a lot easier to find and read the error message that was printed
- Includes all changes from the 2.7.1 release

### Fixed
- Fixed an undefined var name error that could be produced while running PHPCBF
- Fixed bug [#1167][sq-1167] : 3.0.0RC1 PHAR does not work with PEAR standard
- Fixed bug [#1208][sq-1208] : Excluding files doesn't work when using STDIN with a filename specified

## [3.0.0RC1] - 2016-09-02

### Changed
- Progress output now shows E and W in green when a file has fixable errors or warnings
    - Only supported if colors are enabled
- PHPCBF no longer produces verbose output by default (request [#699][sq-699])
    - Use the -v command line argument to show verbose fixing output
    - Use the -q command line argument to disable verbose information if enabled by default
- PHPBF now prints a summary report after fixing files
    - Report shows files that were fixed, how many errors were fixed, and how many remain
- PHPCBF now supports the -p command line argument to print progress information
    - Prints a green F for files where fixes occurred
    - Prints a red E for files that could not be fixed due to an error
    - Use the -q command line argument to disable progress information if enabled by default
- Running unit tests using --verbose no longer throws errors
- Includes all changes from the 2.7.0 release

### Fixed
- Fixed shell error appearing on some systems when trying to find executable paths

[sq-699]: https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/699

## [3.0.0a1] - 2016-07-20

### Changed
- Min PHP version increased from 5.1.2 to 5.4.0
- Added optional caching of results between runs (request [#530][sq-530])
    - Enable the cache by using the --cache command line argument
    - If you want the cache file written somewhere specific, use --cache=/path/to/cacheFile
    - Use the command "phpcs --config-set cache true" to turn caching on by default
    - Use the --no-cache command line argument to disable caching if it is being turned on automatically
- Add support for checking file in parallel (request [#421][sq-421])
    - Tell PHPCS how many files to check at once using the --parallel command line argument
    - To check 100 files at once, using --parallel=100
    - To disable parallel checking if it is being turned on automatically, use --parallel=1
    - Requires PHP to be compiled with the PCNTL package
- The default encoding has been changed from iso-8859-1 to utf-8 (request [#760][sq-760])
    - The --encoding command line argument still works, but you no longer have to set it to process files as utf-8
    - If encoding is being set to utf-8 in a ruleset or on the CLI, it can be safely removed
    - If the iconv PHP extension is not installed, standard non-multibyte aware functions will be used
- Added a new "code" report type to show a code snippet for each error (request [#419][sq-419])
    - The line containing the error is printed, along with 2 lines above and below it to show context
    - The location of the errors is underlined in the code snippet if you also use --colors
    - Use --report=code to generate this report
- Added support for custom filtering of the file list
    - Developers can write their own filter classes to perform custom filtering of the list before the run starts
    - Use the command line arg `--filter=/path/to/filter.php` to specify a filter to use
    - Extend \PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\Filter to also support the core PHPCS extension and path filtering
    - Extend \PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\ExactMatch to get the core filtering and the ability to use blacklists and whitelists
    - The included \PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\GitModified filter is a good example of an ExactMatch filter
- Added support for only checking files that have been locally modified or added in a git repo
    - Use --filter=gitmodified to check these files
    - You still need to give PHPCS a list of files or directories in which to check
- Added automatic discovery of executable paths (request [#571][sq-571])
    - Thanks to [Sergei Morozov][@morozov] for the patch
- You must now pass "-" on the command line to have PHPCS wait for STDIN
    - E.g., phpcs --standard=PSR2 -
    - You can still pipe content via STDIN as normal as PHPCS will see this and process it
    - But without the "-", PHPCS will throw an error if no content or files are passed to it
- All PHP errors generated by sniffs are caught, re-thrown as exceptions, and reported in the standard error reports
    - This should stop bugs inside sniffs causing infinite loops
    - Also stops invalid reports being produced as errors don't print to the screen directly
- Sniff codes are no longer optional
    - If a sniff throws an error or a warning, it must specify an internal code for that message
- The installed_paths config setting can now point directly to a standard
    - Previously, it had to always point to the directory in which the standard lives
- Multiple reports can now be specified using the --report command line argument
    - Report types are separated by commas
    - E.g., --report=full,summary,info
    - Previously, you had to use one argument for each report such as --report=full --report=summary --report=info
- You can now set the severity, message type, and exclude patterns for an entire sniff, category, or standard
    - Previously, this was only available for a single message
- You can now include a single sniff code in a ruleset instead of having to include an entire sniff
    - Including a sniff code will automatically exclude all other messages from that sniff
    - If the sniff is already included by an imported standard, set the sniff severity to 0 and include the specific message you want
- PHPCBF no longer uses patch
    - Files are now always overwritten
    - The --no-patch option has been removed
- Added a --basepath option to strip a directory from the front of file paths in output (request [#470][sq-470])
    - The basepath is absolute or relative to the current directory
    - E.g., to output paths relative to current dir in reports, use --basepath=.
- Ignore rules are now checked when using STDIN (request [#733][sq-733])
- Added an include-pattern tag to rulesets to include a sniff for specific files and folders only (request [#656][sq-656])
    - This is the exact opposite of the exclude-pattern tag
    - This option is only usable within sniffs, not globally like exclude-patterns are
- Added a new -m option to stop error messages from being recorded, which saves a lot of memory
    - PHPCBF always uses this setting to reduce memory as it never outputs error messages
    - Setting the $recordErrors member var inside custom report classes is no longer supported (use -m instead)
- Exit code 2 is now used to indicate fixable errors were found (request [#930][sq-930])
    - Exit code 3 is now used for general script execution errors
    - Exit code 1 is used to indicate that coding standard errors were found, but none are fixable
    - Exit code 0 is unchanged and continues to mean no coding standard errors found

### Removed
- The included PHPCS standard has been removed
    - All rules are now found inside the phpcs.xml.dist file
    - Running "phpcs" without any arguments from a git clone will use this ruleset
- The included SVN pre-commit hook has been removed
    - Hooks for version control systems will no longer be maintained within the PHPCS project
