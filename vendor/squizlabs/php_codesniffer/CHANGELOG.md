# Changelog

The file documents changes to the PHP_CodeSniffer project.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [3.10.1] - 2024-05-22

### Added
- Documentation for the following sniffs:
    - Generic.Commenting.DocComment
    - Thanks to [Rodrigo Primo][@rodrigoprimo] for the patch.

### Changed
- The following have received efficiency improvements:
    - Type handling in the PHP Tokenizer
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch.
- Various housekeeping, including improvements to the tests and documentation.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for their contributions.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#110], [#437], [#475]: `File::findStartOfStatement()`: the start of statement/expression determination for tokens in parentheses/short array brackets/others scopes, nested within match expressions, was incorrect in most cases.
    The trickle down effect of the bug fixes made to the `File::findStartOfStatement()` method, is that the Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent and the PEAR.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent sniffs should now be able to correctly determine and fix the indent for match expressions containing nested expressions.
    These fixes also fix an issue with the `Squiz.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration` sniff and possibly other, unreported bugs.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#504]: The tokenizer could inadvertently mistake the last parameter in a function call using named arguments for a DNF type.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#508]: Tokenizer/PHP: extra hardening against handling parse errors in the type handling layer.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

## [3.10.0] - 2024-05-20

### Added
- Tokenizer support for PHP 8.2 Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) types. [#3731][sq-3731], [#387], [#461]
    - Includes new `T_TYPE_OPEN_PARENTHESIS` and `T_TYPE_CLOSE_PARENTHESIS` tokens to represent the parentheses in DNF types.
    - These new tokens, like other parentheses, will have the `parenthesis_opener` and `parenthesis_closer` token array indexes set and the tokens between them will have the `nested_parenthesis` index.
    - The `File::getMethodProperties()`, `File::getMethodParameters()` and `File::getMemberProperties()` methods now all support DNF types. [#471], [#472], [#473]
    - Additionally, the following sniff has been updated to support DNF types:
        - Generic.PHP.LowerCaseType [#478]
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patches.

        When running in `-q` (quiet) mode, the deprecation notices will be hidden.
    - Deprecated sniffs will still run and using them will have no impact on the exit code for a scan.
    - In ruleset "explain"-mode (`-e`) an asterix `*` will show next to deprecated sniffs.
    - Sniff maintainers are advised to read through the PR description for full details on how to use this feature for their own (deprecated) sniffs.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- New `Generic.CodeAnalysis.RequireExplicitBooleanOperatorPrecedence` sniff. [#197]
    - Forbid mixing different binary boolean operators within a single expression without making precedence clear using parentheses
    - Thanks to [Tim Düsterhus][@TimWolla] for the contribution
- Squiz.PHP.EmbeddedPhp : the sniff will now also examine the formatting of embedded PHP statements using short open echo tags. [#27]
    - Includes a new `ShortOpenEchoNoSemicolon` errorcode to allow for selectively ignoring missing semicolons in single line embedded PHP snippets within short open echo tags.
    - The other error codes are the same and do not distinguish between what type of open tag was used.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - The warning is only displayed on PHPUnit 7.3.0 and higher.
    - The warning will be elevated to a test failure in PHPCS 4.0.
    - Thanks to [Dan Wallis][@fredden] for the patch
- The following sniffs have received performance related improvements:

### Deprecated
- Support for scanning JavaScript and CSS files. See [#2448][sq-2448].
    - This also means that all sniffs which are only aimed at JavaScript or CSS files are now deprecated.
    - The Javascript and CSS Tokenizers, all Javascript and CSS specific sniffs, and support for JS and CSS in select sniffs which support multiple file types, will be removed in version 4.0.0.
- The abstract `PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\ExactMatch::getBlacklist()` and `PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\ExactMatch::getWhitelist()` methods are deprecated and will be removed in the 4.0 release. See [#198].
    - In version 4.0, these methods will be replaced with abstract `ExactMatch::getDisallowedFiles()` and `ExactMatch::getAllowedFiles()` methods
    - To make Filters extending `ExactMatch` cross-version compatible with both PHP_CodeSniffer 3.9.0+ as well as 4.0+, implement the new `getDisallowedFiles()` and `getAllowedFiles()` methods.
        - When both the `getDisallowedFiles()` and `getAllowedFiles()` methods as well as the `getBlacklist()` and `getWhitelist()` are available, the new methods will take precedence over the old methods.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The MySource standard and all sniffs in it. See [#2471][sq-2471].
    - The MySource standard and all sniffs in it will be removed in version 4.0.0.

    - This sniff will be removed in version 4.0.0.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

### Fixed

- The `squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer` repository has been abandoned. The `PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer` repository will serve as the continuation of the project. For more information about this change, please read the [announcement](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/3932).
    - Installation of PHP_CodeSniffer via PEAR is no longer supported.
        - Users will need to switch to another installation method.
        - Note: this does not affect the PEAR sniffs.
    - For Composer users, nothing changes.
        - **_In contrast to earlier information, the `squizlabs/php_codesniffer` package now points to the new repository and everything will continue to work as before._**
    - PHIVE users may need to clear the PHIVE URL cache.
        - PHIVE users who don't use the package alias, but refer to the package URL, will need to update the URL from `https://squizlabs.github.io/PHP_CodeSniffer/phars/` to `https://phars.phpcodesniffer.com/phars/`.
    - Users who download the PHAR files using curl or wget, will need to update the download URL from `https://squizlabs.github.io/PHP_CodeSniffer/[phpcs|phpcbf].phar` or `https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSnifffer/releases/latest/download/[phpcs|phpcbf].phar` to `https://phars.phpcodesniffer.com/[phpcs|phpcbf].phar`.
    - For users who install PHP_CodeSniffer via the [Setup-PHP](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php/) action runner for GitHub Actions, nothing changes.
    - Users using a git clone will need to update the clone address from `git@github.com:squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer.git` to `git@github.com:PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer.git`.
        - Contributors will need to fork the new repo and add both the new fork as well as the new repo as remotes to their local git copy of PHP_CodeSniffer.
        - Users who have (valid) open issues or pull requests in the `squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer` repository are invited to resubmit these to the `PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer` repository.

### Added
- Runtime support for PHP 8.3. All known PHP 8.3 deprecation notices have been fixed

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Added support for PHP 8.2 `true` as a stand-alone type to a number of sniffs
    - Generic.PHP.LowerCaseType
    - PSr12.Functions.NullableTypeDeclaration
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - If any of these tests use the PHPUnit `setUp()`/`tearDown()` methods or overload the `setUp()` in the `AbstractSniffUnitTest` test case, they will need to be adjusted. See the [PR details for further information](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/pull/59/commits/bc302dd977877a22c5e60d42a2f6b7d9e9192dab)
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

### Changed
- Changes have been made to the way PHPCS handles invalid sniff properties being set in a custom ruleset
    - Fixes PHP 8.2 deprecation notices for properties set in a (custom) ruleset for complete standards/complete sniff categories
    - Invalid sniff properties set for individual sniffs will now result in an error and halt the execution of PHPCS
        - A descriptive error message is provided to allow users to fix their ruleset
    - Sniff properties set for complete standards/complete sniff categories will now only be set on sniffs which explicitly support the property
        - The property will be silently ignored for those sniffs which do not support the property
    - Invalid sniff properties set for sniffs via inline annotations will result in an informative `Internal.PropertyDoesNotExist` errror on line 1 of the scanned file, but will not halt the execution of PHPCS
    - For sniff developers, it is strongly recommended for sniffs to explicitly declare any user-adjustable public properties
        - If dynamic properties need to be supported for a sniff, either declare the magic __set()/__get()/__isset()/__unset() methods on the sniff or let the sniff extend stdClass
        - Note: The `#[\AllowDynamicProperties]` attribute will have no effect for properties which are being set in rulesets
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The third parameter for the Ruleset::setSniffProperty() method has been changed to expect an array
    - Sniff developers/integrators of PHPCS may need to make some small adjustments to allow for this change
    - Existing code will continue to work but will throw a deprecation error
    - The backwards compatiblity layer will be removed in PHPCS 4.0
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- When using `auto` report width (the default) a value of 80 columns will be used if the width cannot be determined
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Sniff error messages are now more informative to help bugs get reported to the correct project
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.UnusedFunctionParameter will now ignore magic methods for which the signature is defined by PHP
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.WhiteSpace.IncrementDecrementSpacing now detects more spacing issues
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PSR2.Classes.PropertyDeclaration now enforces that the readonly modifier comes after the visibility modifier
    - PSR2 and PSR12 do not have documented rules for this as they pre-date the readonly modifier
    - PSR-PER has been used to confirm the order of this keyword so it can be applied to PSR2 and PSR12 correctly
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PEAR.Commenting.FunctionComment + Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment: the SpacingAfter error can now be auto-fixed
    - Thanks to [Dan Wallis][@fredden] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.InnerFunctions sniff no longer reports on OO methods for OO structures declared within a function or closure
    - Thanks to [@Daimona] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.NonExecutableCode will now also flag redundant return statements just before a closure close brace
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Runtime performance improvement for PHPCS CLI users. The improvement should be most noticeable for users on Windows.
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The following sniffs have received performance related improvements:
    - Generic.PHP.LowerCaseConstant
    - Generic.PHP.LowerCaseType
    - PSR12.Files.OpenTag
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patches
- The -e (explain) command will now list sniffs in natural order
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - If sniffs are just using constant to find arrow functions, they will continue to work without modification
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- File::findStartOfStatement() now works correctly when passed the last token in a statement
- File::getMethodParameters() now supports PHP 8.0 constructor property promotion

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- File::getMethodProperties() now includes a "return_type_end_token" index in the return value
    - This indicates the last token in the return type, which is helpful when checking union types
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Include patterns are now ignored when processing STDIN
    - Previously, checks using include patterns were excluded when processing STDIN when no file path was provided via --stdin-path
    - Now, all include and exclude rules are ignored when no file path is provided, allowing all checks to run

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Spaces are now correctly escaped in the paths to external on Windows
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - Set the ignoreTypeHints array property to a list of type hints to ignore
    - Thanks to [Petr Bugyík][@o5] for the patch
- Generic.Formatting.MultipleStatementAlignment can now align statements at the start of the assignment token
    - Previously, the sniff enforced that the values were aligned, even if this meant the assignment tokens were not
    - Now, the sniff can enforce that the assignment tokens are aligned, even if this means the values are not
    - Set the "alignAtEnd" sniff property to "false" to align the assignment tokens
    - The default remains at "true", so the assigned values are aligned
    - Thanks to [John P. Bloch][@johnpbloch] for the patch
- Generic.PHP.LowerCaseType now supports checking of typed properties
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PEAR.Commenting.FunctionComment and Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment sniffs can now ignore private and protected methods
    - Set the "minimumVisibility" sniff property to "protected" to ignore private methods
    - Set the "minimumVisibility" sniff property to "public" to ignore both private and protected methods
    - The default remains at "private", so all methods are checked
    - Thanks to [Vincent Langlet][@VincentLanglet] for the patch
- PEAR.Commenting.FunctionComment and Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment sniffs can now ignore return tags in any method
    - Previously, only `__construct()` and `__destruct()` were ignored
    - Set the list of method names to ignore in the "specialMethods" sniff property
    - The default remains at "__construct" and "__destruct" only
    - Thanks to [Vincent Langlet][@VincentLanglet] for the patch
- PSR2.ControlStructures.SwitchDeclaration now supports nested switch statements where every branch terminates
    - Previously, if a CASE only contained a SWITCH and no direct terminating statement, a fall-through error was displayed
    - Now, the error is suppressed if every branch of the SWITCH has a terminating statement
    - Thanks to [Vincent Langlet][@VincentLanglet] for the patch
- The PSR2.Methods.FunctionCallSignature.SpaceBeforeCloseBracket error message is now reported on the closing parenthesis token
    - Previously, the error was being reported on the function keyword, leading to confusing line numbers in the error report
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment is now able to ignore function comments that are only inheritdoc statements
    - Set the skipIfInheritdoc sniff property to "true" to skip checking function comments if the content is only {@inhertidoc}
    - The default remains at "false", so these comments will continue to report errors
    - Thanks to [Jess Myrbo][@xjm] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment now supports the PHP 8 mixed type
    - Thanks to [Vadim Borodavko][@javer] for the patch

## [3.5.3] - 2019-12-04

### Changed
- The PHP 7.4 T_FN token has been made available for older versions
    - T_FN represents the fn string used for arrow functions
    - The double arrow becomes the scope opener, and uses a new T_FN_ARROW token type
    - The token after the statement (normally a semicolon) becomes the scope closer
    - The token is also associated with the opening and closing parenthesis of the statement
    - Any functions named "fn" will have a T_FN token for the function name, but have no scope information
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the help with this change
- PHP 7.4 numeric separators are now tokenized in the same way when using older PHP versions
    - Previously, a number like 1_000 would tokenize as T_LNUMBER (1), T_STRING (_000)
    - Now, the number tokenizes as T_LNUMBER (1_000)
    - Sniff developers should consider how numbers with underscores impact their custom sniffs
- The PHPCS file cache now takes file permissions into account
    - The cache is now invalidated for a file when its permissions are changed
- File::getMethodParameters() now supports arrow functions
- File::getMethodProperties() now supports arrow functions
- Added Fixer::changeCodeBlockIndent() to change the indent of a code block while auto-fixing
    - Can be used to either increase or decrease the indent
    - Useful when moving the start position of something like a closure, where you want the content to also move
- Added Generic.Files.ExecutableFile sniff
    - Ensures that files are not executable
    - Thanks to [Matthew Peveler][@MasterOdin] for the contribution
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.EmptyPhpStatement now reports unnecessary semicolons after control structure closing braces
    - Thanks to [Vincent Langlet][@VincentLanglet] for the patch
- Generic.PHP.LowerCaseKeyword now enforces that the "fn" keyword is lowercase
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent now supports static arrow functions
- PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature now adjusts the indent of function argument contents during auto-fixing
    - Previously, only the first line of an argument was changed, leading to inconsistent indents
    - This change also applies to PSR2.Methods.FunctionCallSignature
- PSR2.ControlStructures.ControlStructureSpacing now checks whitespace before the closing parenthesis of multi-line control structures
    - Previously, it incorrectly applied the whitespace check for single-line definitions only
- PSR12.Functions.ReturnTypeDeclaration now checks the return type of arrow functions
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- PSR12.Traits.UseDeclaration now ensures all trait import statements are grouped together
    - Previously, the trait import section of the class ended when the first non-import statement was found
    - Checking now continues throughout the class to ensure all statements are grouped together

## [3.5.0] - 2019-09-27

### Changed
- The included PSR12 standard is now complete and ready to use
    - Check your code using PSR-12 by running PHPCS with --standard=PSR12
- Added support for PHP 7.4 typed properties
    - The nullable operator is now tokenized as T_NULLABLE inside property types, as it is elsewhere
    - To get the type of a member var, use the File::getMemberProperties() method, which now contains a "type" array index
        - This contains the type of the member var, or a blank string if not specified
        - If the type is nullable, the return type will contain the leading ?
        - If a type is specified, the position of the first token in the type will be set in a "type_token" array index
        - If a type is specified, the position of the last token in the type will be set in a "type_end_token" array index
        - If the type is nullable, a "nullable_type" array index will also be set to TRUE
        - If the type contains namespace information, it will be cleaned of whitespace and comments in the return value
- The PSR1 standard now correctly bans alternate PHP tags
    - Previously, it only banned short open tags and not the pre-7.0 alternate tags
- Added support for only checking files that have been locally staged in a git repo
    - Use --filter=gitstaged to check these files
    - You still need to give PHPCS a list of files or directories in which to apply the filter
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- JSON reports now end with a newline character
- The phpcs.xsd schema now validates phpcs-only and phpcbf-only attributes correctly
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - Some tokenizer methods were also throwing RuntimeException but now correctly throw TokenizerException
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The File::getMethodParameters() method now returns more information, and supports closure USE groups
    - If a type hint is specified, the position of the last token in the hint will be set in a "type_hint_end_token" array index
    - If a default is specified, the position of the first token in the default value will be set in a "default_token" array index
    - If a default is specified, the position of the equals sign will be set in a "default_equal_token" array index
    - If the param is not the last, the position of the comma will be set in a "comma_token" array index
    - If the param is passed by reference, the position of the reference operator will be set in a "reference_token" array index
    - If the param is variable length, the position of the variadic operator will be set in a "variadic_token" array index
- The T_LIST token and it's opening and closing parentheses now contain references to each other in the tokens array
    - Uses the same parenthesis_opener/closer/owner indexes as other tokens
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The T_ANON_CLASS token and it's opening and closing parentheses now contain references to each other in the tokens array
    - Uses the same parenthesis_opener/closer/owner indexes as other tokens
    - Only applicable if the anon class is passing arguments to the constructor
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The PHP 7.4 T_BAD_CHARACTER token has been made available for older versions
    - Allows you to safely look for this token, but it will not appear unless checking with PHP 7.4+
- Metrics are now available for Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing
    - Use the "info" report to see blank lines before/after functions
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - Checks whitespace between the spread operator and the variable/function call it applies to
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added PSR12.Classes.AnonClassDeclaration sniff
    - Enforces the formatting of anonymous classes
- Added PSR12.Classes.ClosingBrace sniff
    - Enforces that closing braces of classes/interfaces/traits/functions are not followed by a comment or statement
- Added PSR12.ControlStructures.BooleanOperatorPlacement sniff
    - Enforces that boolean operators between conditions are consistently at the start or end of the line
- Added PSR12.ControlStructures.ControlStructureSpacing sniff
    - Enforces that spacing and indents are correct inside control structure parenthesis
- Added PSR12.Files.DeclareStatement sniff
    - Enforces the formatting of declare statements within a file
- Added PSR12.Files.FileHeader sniff
    - Enforces the order and formatting of file header blocks
- Added PSR12.Files.ImportStatement sniff
    - Enforces the formatting of import statements within a file
- Added PSR12.Files.OpenTag sniff
    - Enforces that the open tag is on a line by itself when used at the start of a PHP-only file
- Added PSR12.Functions.ReturnTypeDeclaration sniff
    - Enforces the formatting of return type declarations in functions and closures
- Added PSR12.Properties.ConstantVisibility sniff
    - Enforces that constants must have their visibility defined
    - Uses a warning instead of an error due to this conditionally requiring the project to support PHP 7.1+
- Added PSR12.Traits.UseDeclaration sniff
    - Enforces the formatting of trait import statements within a class
- Generic.Files.LineLength ignoreComments property now ignores comments at the end of a line
    - Previously, this property was incorrectly causing the sniff to ignore any line that ended with a comment
    - Now, the trailing comment is not included in the line length, but the rest of the line is still checked
- Generic.Files.LineLength now only ignores unwrappable comments when the comment is on a line by itself
    - Previously, a short unwrappable comment at the end of the line would have the sniff ignore the entire line
- Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing no longer checks spacing around assignment operators inside function calls
    - Use the Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing sniff to enforce spacing around assignment operators
        - Note that this sniff checks spacing around all assignment operators, not just inside function calls
    - The Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing.NoSpaceBeforeEquals error has been removed
        - Use Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing.NoSpaceBefore instead
    - The Generic.Functions.FunctionCallArgumentSpacing.NoSpaceAfterEquals error has been removed
        - Use Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing.NoSpaceAfter instead
    - This also changes the PEAR/PSR2/PSR12 standards so they no longer check assignment operators inside function calls
        - They were previously checking these operators when they should not have
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent no longer performs exact indents checking for chained method calls
    - Other sniffs can be used to enforce chained method call indent rules
    - Thanks to [Pieter Frenssen][@pfrenssen] for the patch
- PEAR.WhiteSpace.ObjectOperatorIndent now supports multi-level chained statements
    - When enabled, chained calls must be indented 1 level more or less than the previous line
    - Set the new "multilevel" setting to TRUE in a ruleset.xml file to enable this behaviour
    - Thanks to [Marcos Passos][@marcospassos] for the patch
- PSR2.ControlStructures.ControlStructureSpacing now allows whitespace after the opening parenthesis if followed by a comment
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- PSR2.Classes.PropertyDeclaration now enforces a single space after a property type keyword
    - The PSR2 standard itself excludes this new check as it is not defined in the written standard
    - Using the PSR12 standard will enforce this check
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment no longer requires blank line before comment if it's the first content after the PHP open tag
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing now has more accurate error messages
    - This includes renaming the SpaceAfterDefault error code to SpaceAfterEquals, which reflects the real error
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing now checks for no space after a reference operator
    - If you don't want this new behaviour, exclude the SpacingAfterReference error message in a ruleset.xml file
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing now checks for no space after a variadic operator
    - If you don't want this new behaviour, exclude the SpacingAfterVariadic error message in a ruleset.xml file
- Squiz.Functions.MultiLineFunctionDeclaration now has improved fixing for the FirstParamSpacing and UseFirstParamSpacing errors
- Squiz.Operators.IncrementDecrementUsage now suggests pre-increment of variables instead of post-increment
    - This change does not enforce pre-increment over post-increment; only the suggestion has changed
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.DisallowMultipleAssignments now has a second error code for when assignments are found inside control structure conditions
    - The new error code is Squiz.PHP.DisallowMultipleAssignments.FoundInControlStructure
    - All other multiple assignment cases use the existing error code Squiz.PHP.DisallowMultipleAssignments.Found
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing now applies beforeFirst and afterLast spacing rules to nested functions
    - Previously, these rules only applied to the first and last function in a class, interface, or trait
    - These rules now apply to functions nested in any statement block, including other functions and conditions
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing now has improved handling of parse errors
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing now checks spacing around the instanceof operator
    - Thanks to [Jakub Chábek][@grongor] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing can now enforce a single space before assignment operators
    - Previously, the sniff this spacing as multiple assignment operators are sometimes aligned
    - Now, you can set the ignoreSpacingBeforeAssignments sniff property to FALSE to enable checking
    - Default remains TRUE, so spacing before assignments is not checked by default
    - Thanks to [Jakub Chábek][@grongor] for the patch

## [3.4.0] - 2018-12-20

### Deprecated
- The Generic.Formatting.NoSpaceAfterCast sniff has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - The functionality of this sniff is now available in the Generic.Formatting.SpaceAfterCast sniff
        - Include the Generic.Formatting.SpaceAfterCast sniff and set the "spacing" property to "0"
    - As soon as possible, replace all instances of the old sniff code with the new sniff code and property setting
        - The existing sniff will continue to work until version 4 has been released

### Changed
- Rule include patterns in a ruleset.xml file are now evaluated as OR instead of AND
    - Previously, a file had to match every include pattern and no exclude patterns to be included
    - Now, a file must match at least one include pattern and no exclude patterns to be included
    - This is a bug fix as include patterns are already documented to work this way
- New token T_BITWISE_NOT added for the bitwise not operator
    - This token was previously tokenized as T_NONE
    - Any sniffs specifically looking for T_NONE tokens with a tilde as the contents must now also look for T_BITWISE_NOT
    - Sniffs can continue looking for T_NONE as well as T_BITWISE_NOT to support older PHP_CodeSniffer versions
- All types of binary casting are now tokenized as T_BINARY_CAST
    - Previously, the 'b' in 'b"some string with $var"' would be a T_BINARY_CAST, but only when the string contained a var
    - This change ensures the 'b' is always tokenized as T_BINARY_CAST
    - This change also converts '(binary)' from T_STRING_CAST to T_BINARY_CAST
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the help with this patch
- Array properties set inside a ruleset.xml file can now extend a previous value instead of always overwriting it
    - e.g., if you include a ruleset that defines forbidden functions, can you now add to that list instead of having to redefine it
    - To use this feature, add extends="true" to the property tag
        - e.g., property name="forbiddenFunctionNames" type="array" extend="true"
    - Thanks to [Michael Moravec][@Majkl578] for the patch
- If $XDG_CACHE_HOME is set and points to a valid directory, it will be used for caching instead of the system temp directory
- PHPCBF now disables parallel running if you are passing content on STDIN
    - Stops an error from being shown after the fixed output is printed
- The progress report now shows files with tokenizer errors as skipped (S) instead of a warning (W)
    - The tokenizer error is still displayed in reports as normal
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The Squiz standard now ensures there is no space between an increment/decrement operator and its variable
- The File::getMethodProperties() method now includes a has_body array index in the return value
    - FALSE if the method has no body (as with abstract and interface methods) or TRUE otherwise
    - Thanks to [Chris Wilkinson][@thewilkybarkid] for the patch
- The File::getTokensAsString() method now throws an exception if the $start param is invalid
    - If the $length param is invalid, an empty string will be returned
    - Stops an infinite loop when the function is passed invalid data
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Added new Generic.CodeAnalysis.EmptyPHPStatement sniff
    - Warns when it finds empty PHP open/close tag combinations or superfluous semicolons
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added new Generic.Formatting.SpaceBeforeCast sniff
    - Ensures there is exactly 1 space before a type cast, unless the cast statement is indented or multi-line
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added new Generic.VersionControl.GitMergeConflict sniff
    - Detects merge conflict artifacts left in files
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added Generic.WhiteSpace.IncrementDecrementSpacing sniff
    - Ensures there is no space between the operator and the variable it applies to
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added PSR12.Functions.NullableTypeDeclaration sniff
    - Ensures there is no space after the question mark in a nullable type declaration
    - Thanks to [Timo Schinkel][@timoschinkel] for the contribution
- A number of sniffs have improved support for methods in anonymous classes
    - These sniffs would often throw the same error twice for functions in nested classes
    - Error messages have also been changed to be less confusing
    - The full list of affected sniffs is:
        - Generic.NamingConventions.CamelCapsFunctionName
        - PEAR.NamingConventions.ValidFunctionName
        - PSR1.Methods.CamelCapsMethodName
        - PSR2.Methods.MethodDeclaration
        - Squiz.Scope.MethodScope
        - Squiz.Scope.StaticThisUsage
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.UnusedFunctionParameter now only skips functions with empty bodies when the class implements an interface
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.UnusedFunctionParameter now has additional error codes to indicate where unused params were found
    - The new error code prefixes are:
        - FoundInExtendedClass: when the class extends another
        - FoundInImplementedInterface: when the class implements an interface
        - Found: used in all other cases, including closures
    - The new error code suffixes are:
        - BeforeLastUsed: the unused param was positioned before the last used param in the function signature
        - AfterLastUsed: the unused param was positioned after the last used param in the function signature
    - This makes the new error code list for this sniff:
        - Found
        - FoundBeforeLastUsed
        - FoundAfterLastUsed
        - FoundInExtendedClass
        - FoundInExtendedClassBeforeLastUsed
        - FoundInExtendedClassAfterLastUsed
        - FoundInImplementedInterface
        - FoundInImplementedInterfaceBeforeLastUsed
        - FoundInImplementedInterfaceAfterLastUsed
    - These errors code make it easier for specific cases to be ignored or promoted using a ruleset.xml file
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Generic.Classes.DuplicateClassName now inspects traits for duplicate names as well as classes and interfaces

    - Override the "ignoreNewlines" setting in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.Formatting.SpaceAfterNot now has a setting to specify how many spaces are required after a NOT operator
    - Default remains 1
    - Override the "spacing" setting in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.Formatting.SpaceAfterNot now has a setting to ignore newline characters after the NOT operator
    - Default remains FALSE, so newlines are not allowed
    - Override the "ignoreNewlines" setting in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PEAR.Functions.FunctionDeclaration now checks spacing before the opening parenthesis of functions with no body
    - Thanks to [Chris Wilkinson][@thewilkybarkid] for the patch

    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Objects.ObjectMemberComma.Missing has been renamed to Squiz.Objects.ObjectMemberComma.Found
    - The error is thrown when the comma is found but not required, so the error code was incorrect
    - If you are referencing the old error code in a ruleset XML file, please use the new code instead
    - If you wish to maintain backwards compatibility, you can provide rules for both the old and new codes
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.ObjectOperatorSpacing is now more tolerant of parse errors

- Squiz.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration no longer removes the array opening brace while fixing
    - This could occur when the opening brace was on a new line and the first array key directly followed
    - This change also stops the KeyNotAligned error message being incorrectly reported in these cases
- Squiz.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration no longer tries to change multi-line arrays to single line when they contain comments
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and some indentation sniffs
- Squiz.Classes.ClassDeclaration no longer enforces spacing rules when a class is followed by a function
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing sniff
- The Squiz.Classes.ValidClassName.NotCamelCaps message now references PascalCase instead of CamelCase
    - The "CamelCase class name" metric produced by the sniff has been changed to "PascalCase class name"
    - This reflects the fact that the class name check is actually a Pascal Case check and not really Camel Case
    - Thanks to [Tom H Anderson][@TomHAnderson] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment no longer enforces spacing rules when an inline comment is followed by a docblock
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing sniff
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing no longer tries to fix operator spacing if the next content is a comment on a new line
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.Commenting.PostStatementComment sniff
    - Also stops PHPCS annotations from being moved to a different line, potentially changing their meaning
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing no longer checks spacing of functions at the top of an embedded PHP block
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.PHP.EmbeddedPHP sniff
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.MemberVarSpacing no longer checks spacing before member vars that come directly after methods
    - Fixes a conflict between this sniff and the Squiz.WhiteSpace.FunctionSpacing sniff
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.SuperfluousWhitespace now recognizes unicode whitespace at the start and end of a file
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

## [3.3.0] - 2018-06-07

### Deprecated
- The Squiz.WhiteSpace.LanguageConstructSpacing sniff has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - The sniff has been moved to the Generic standard, with a new code of Generic.WhiteSpace.LanguageConstructSpacing
    - As soon as possible, replace all instances of the old sniff code with the new sniff code in your ruleset.xml files
        - The existing Squiz sniff will continue to work until version 4 has been released
    - The new Generic sniff now also checks many more language constructs to enforce additional spacing rules
        - Thanks to [Mponos George][@gmponos] for the contribution
- The current method for setting array properties in ruleset files has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - Currently, setting an array value uses the string syntax "print=>echo,create_function=>null"
    - Now, individual array elements are specified using a new "element" tag with "key" and "value" attributes
        - For example, element key="print" value="echo"
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- The T_ARRAY_HINT token has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - The token was used to ensure array type hints were not tokenized as T_ARRAY, but no other type hints were given a special token
    - Array type hints now use the standard T_STRING token instead
    - Sniffs referencing this token type will continue to run without error until version 4, but will not find any T_ARRAY_HINT tokens
- The T_RETURN_TYPE token has been deprecated and will be removed in version 4
    - The token was used to ensure array/self/parent/callable return types were tokenized consistently
    - For namespaced return types, only the last part of the string (the class name) was tokenized as T_RETURN_TYPE
    - This was not consistent and so return types are now left using their original token types so they are not skipped by sniffs
        - The exception are array return types, which are tokenized as T_STRING instead of T_ARRAY, as they are for type hints
    - Sniffs referencing this token type will continue to run without error until version 4, but will not find any T_RETUTN_TYPE tokens
    - To get the return type of a function, use the File::getMethodProperties() method, which now contains a "return_type" array index
        - This contains the return type of the function or closer, or a blank string if not specified
        - If the return type is nullable, the return type will contain the leading ?
            - A nullable_return_type array index in the return value will also be set to true
        - If the return type contains namespace information, it will be cleaned of whitespace and comments
            - To access the original return value string, use the main tokens array

### Added
- This release contains an incomplete version of the PSR-12 coding standard
    - Errors found using this standard should be valid, but it will miss a lot of violations until it is complete
    - If you'd like to test and help, you can use the standard by running PHPCS with --standard=PSR12

### Changed
- Config values set using --runtime-set now override any config values set in rulesets or the CodeSniffer.conf file
- You can now apply include-pattern rules to individual message codes in a ruleset like you can with exclude-pattern rules
    - Previously, include-pattern rules only applied to entire sniffs
    - If a message code has both include and exclude patterns, the exclude patterns will be ignored
- Using PHPCS annotations to selectively re-enable sniffs is now more flexible
    - Previously, you could only re-enable a sniff/category/standard using the exact same code that was disabled
    - Now, you can disable a standard and only re-enable a specific category or sniff
    - Or, you can disable a specific sniff and have it re-enable when you re-enable the category or standard
- The value of array sniff properties can now be set using phpcs:set annotations
    - e.g., phpcs:set Standard.Category.SniffName property[] key=>value,key2=>value2
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- PHPCS annotations now remain as T_PHPCS_* tokens instead of reverting to comment tokens when --ignore-annotations is used
    - This stops sniffs (especially commenting sniffs) from generating a large number of false errors when ignoring
    - Any custom sniffs that are using the T_PHPCS_* tokens to detect annotations may need to be changed to ignore them
        - Check $phpcsFile->config->annotations to see if annotations are enabled and ignore when false
- You can now use fully or partially qualified class names for custom reports instead of absolute file paths
    - To support this, you must specify an autoload file in your ruleset.xml file and use it to register an autoloader
    - Your autoloader will need to load your custom report class when requested
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The JSON report format now does escaping in error source codes as well as error messages
    - Thanks to [Martin Vasel][@marvasDE] for the patch
- Invalid installed_paths values are now ignored instead of causing a fatal error
- Improved testability of custom rulesets by allowing the installed standards to be overridden
    - Thanks to [Timo Schinkel][@timoschinkel] for the patch
- The key used for caching PHPCS runs now includes all set config values
    - This fixes a problem where changing config values (e.g., via --runtime-set) used an incorrect cache file
- The "Function opening brace placement" metric has been separated into function and closure metrics in the info report
    - Closures are no longer included in the "Function opening brace placement" metric
    - A new "Closure opening brace placement" metric now shows information for closures
- Multi-line T_YIELD_FROM statements are now replicated properly for older PHP versions
- The PSR2 standard no longer produces 2 error messages when the AS keyword in a foreach loop is not lowercase
- Specifying a path to a non-existent dir when using the `--report-[reportType]=/path/to/report` CLI option no longer throws an exception
    - This now prints a readable error message, as it does when using `--report-file`
- The File::getMethodParamaters() method now includes a type_hint_token array index in the return value
    - Provides the position in the token stack of the first token in the type hint
- The File::getMethodProperties() method now includes a return_type_token array index in the return value
    - Provides the position in the token stack of the first token in the return type
- The File::getTokensAsString() method can now optionally return original (non tab-replaced) content
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Removed Squiz.PHP.DisallowObEndFlush from the Squiz standard
    - If you use this sniff and want to continue banning ob_end_flush(), use Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions instead
    - You will need to set the forbiddenFunctions property in your ruleset.xml file
- Removed Squiz.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions from the Squiz standard
    - Replaced by using the forbiddenFunctions property of Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions in the Squiz ruleset.xml
    - Functionality of the Squiz standard remains the same, but the error codes are now different
    - Previously, Squiz.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions.Found and Squiz.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions.FoundWithAlternative
    - Now, Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions.Found and Generic.PHP.ForbiddenFunctions.FoundWithAlternative
- Added new Generic.PHP.LowerCaseType sniff
    - Ensures PHP types used for type hints, return types, and type casting are lowercase
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added new Generic.WhiteSpace.ArbitraryParenthesesSpacing sniff
    - Generates an error for whitespace inside parenthesis that don't belong to a function call/declaration or control structure
    - Generates a warning for any empty parenthesis found
    - Allows the required spacing to be set using the spacing sniff property (default is 0)
    - Allows newlines to be used by setting the ignoreNewlines sniff property (default is false)
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Added new PSR12.Classes.ClassInstantiation sniff
    - Ensures parenthesis are used when instantiating a new class
- Added new PSR12.Keywords.ShortFormTypeKeywords sniff
    - Ensures the short form of PHP types is used when type casting
- Added new PSR12.Namespaces.CompundNamespaceDepth sniff
    - Ensures compound namespace use statements have a max depth of 2 levels
    - The max depth can be changed by setting the 'maxDepth' sniff property in a ruleset.xml file
- Added new PSR12.Operators.OperatorSpacing sniff
    - Ensures operators are preceded and followed by at least 1 space
- Improved core support for grouped property declarations
    - Also improves support in Squiz.WhiteSpace.ScopeKeywordSpacing and Squiz.WhiteSpace.MemberVarSpacing
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.Commenting.DocComment now produces a NonParamGroup error when tags are mixed in with the @param tag group
    - It would previously throw either a NonParamGroup or ParamGroup error depending on the order of tags
    - This change allows the NonParamGroup error to be suppressed in a ruleset to allow the @param group to contain other tags
    - Thanks to [Phil Davis][@phil-davis] for the patch
- Generic.Commenting.DocComment now continues checks param tags even if the doc comment short description is missing
    - This change allows the MissingShort error to be suppressed in a ruleset without all other errors being suppressed as well
    - Thanks to [Phil Davis][@phil-davis] for the patch
- Generic.CodeAnalysis.AssignmentInCondition now reports a different error code for assignments found in WHILE conditions
    - The return value of a function call is often assigned in a WHILE condition, so this change makes it easier to exclude these cases
    - The new code for this error message is Generic.CodeAnalysis.AssignmentInCondition.FoundInWhileCondition
    - The error code for all other cases remains as Generic.CodeAnalysis.AssignmentInCondition.Found
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Generic.Functions.OpeningFunctionBraceBsdAllman now longer leaves trailing whitespace when moving the opening brace during fixing
    - Also applies to fixes made by PEAR.Functions.FunctionDeclaration and Squiz.Functions.MultiLineFunctionDeclaration
- Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent now does a better job of fixing the indent of multi-line comments
- Generic.WhiteSpace.ScopeIndent now does a better job of fixing the indent of PHP open and close tags
- PEAR.Commenting.FunctionComment now report a different error code for param comment lines with too much padding
    - Previously, any lines of a param comment that don't start at the exact comment position got the same error code
    - Now, only comment lines with too little padding use ParamCommentAlignment as they are clearly mistakes
    - Comment lines with too much padding may be using precision alignment as now use ParamCommentAlignmentExceeded
    - This allows for excessive padding to be excluded from a ruleset while continuing to enforce a minimum padding
- PEAR.WhiteSpace.ObjectOperatorIndent now checks the indent of more chained operators
    - Previously, it only checked chains beginning with a variable
    - Now, it checks chains beginning with function calls, static class names, etc
- Squiz.Arrays.ArrayDeclaration now continues checking array formatting even if the key indent is not correct
    - Allows for using different array indent rules while still checking/fixing double arrow and value alignment
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment has improved support for tab-indented comments
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment auto fixing no longer breaks when two block comments follow each other
    - Also stopped single-line block comments from being auto fixed when they are embedded in other code
    - Also fixed as issue found when PHPCS annotations were used inside a block comment
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment.LastLineIndent is now able to be fixed with phpcbf
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.BlockComment now aligns star-prefixed lines under the opening tag while fixing, instead of indenting them
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment.IncorrectTypeHint message no longer contains cut-off suggested type hints
- Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment now uses a new error code for inline comments at the end of a function
    - Previously, all inline comments followed by a blank line threw a Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment.SpacingAfter error
    - Now, inline comments at the end of a function will instead throw Squiz.Commenting.InlineComment.SpacingAfterAtFunctionEnd
    - If you previously excluded SpacingAfter, add an exclusion for SpacingAfterAtFunctionEnd to your ruleset as well
    - If you previously only included SpacingAfter, consider including SpacingAfterAtFunctionEnd as well
    - The Squiz standard now excludes SpacingAfterAtFunctionEnd as the blank line is checked elsewhere
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.ControlStructures.ControlSignature now errors when a comment follows the closing brace of an earlier body
    - Applies to catch, finally, else, elseif, and do/while structures
    - The included PSR2 standard now enforces this rule
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Formatting.OperatorBracket.MissingBrackets message has been changed to remove the word "arithmetic"
    - The sniff checks more than just arithmetic operators, so the message is now clearer
- Sniffs.Operators.ComparisonOperatorUsage now detects more cases of implicit true comparisons
    - It could previously be confused by comparisons used as function arguments
- Squiz.PHP.CommentedOutCode now ignores simple @-style annotation comments so they are not flagged as commented out code
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.CommentedOutCode now ignores a greater number of short comments so they are not flagged as commented out code
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.PHP.DisallowComparisonAssignment no longer errors when using the null coalescing operator
    - Given this operator is used almost exclusively to assign values, it didn't make sense to generate an error
- Squiz.WhiteSpacing.FunctionSpacing now has a property to specify how many blank lines should be before the first class method
    - Only applies when a method is the first code block in a class (i.e., there are no member vars before it)
    - Override the 'spacingBeforeFirst' property in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - If not set, the sniff will use whatever value is set for the existing 'spacing' property
- Squiz.WhiteSpacing.FunctionSpacing now has a property to specify how many blank lines should be after the last class method
    - Only applies when a method is the last code block in a class (i.e., there are no member vars after it)
    - Override the 'spacingAfterLast' property in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - If not set, the sniff will use whatever value is set for the existing 'spacing' property

## [3.2.3] - 2018-02-21

### Changed
- The new phpcs: comment syntax can now be prefixed with an at symbol ( @phpcs: )
    - This restores the behaviour of the previous syntax where these comments are ignored by doc generators

## [3.2.0] - 2017-12-13

### Deprecated
- This release deprecates the @codingStandards comment syntax used for sending commands to PHP_CodeSniffer
    - The existing syntax will continue to work in all version 3 releases, but will be removed in version 4
    - The comment formats have been replaced by a shorter syntax:
        - @codingStandardsIgnoreFile becomes phpcs:ignoreFile
        - @codingStandardsIgnoreStart becomes phpcs:disable
        - @codingStandardsIgnoreEnd becomes phpcs:enable
        - @codingStandardsIgnoreLine becomes phpcs:ignore
        - @codingStandardsChangeSetting becomes phpcs:set
    - The new syntax allows for additional developer comments to be added after a -- separator
        - This is useful for describing why a code block is being ignored, or why a setting is being changed
        - E.g., phpcs:disable -- This code block must be left as-is.
    - Comments using the new syntax are assigned new comment token types to allow them to be detected:
        - phpcs:ignoreFile has the token T_PHPCS_IGNORE_FILE
        - phpcs:disable has the token T_PHPCS_DISABLE
        - phpcs:enable has the token T_PHPCS_ENABLE
        - phpcs:ignore has the token T_PHPCS_IGNORE
        - phpcs:set has the token T_PHPCS_SET

### Changed
- The phpcs:disable and phpcs:ignore comments can now selectively ignore specific sniffs (request [#604][sq-604])
    - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic.Commenting.Todo.Found for a specific message
    - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic.Commenting.Todo for a whole sniff
    - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic.Commenting for a whole category of sniffs
    - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic for a whole standard
    - Multiple sniff codes can be specified by comma separating them
        - E.g., phpcs:disable Generic.Commenting.Todo,PSR1.Files
- @codingStandardsIgnoreLine comments now only ignore the following line if they are on a line by themselves
    - If they are at the end of an existing line, they will only ignore the line they are on
    - Stops some lines from accidentally being ignored
    - Same rule applies for the new phpcs:ignore comment syntax
- PSR1.Files.SideEffects now respects the new phpcs:disable comment syntax
    - The sniff will no longer check any code that is between phpcs:disable and phpcs:enable comments
    - The sniff does not support phpcs:ignore; you must wrap code structures with disable/enable comments
    - Previously, there was no way to have this sniff ignore parts of a file
- Fixed a problem where PHPCS would sometimes hang waiting for STDIN, or read incomplete versions of large files
    - Thanks to [Arne Jørgensen][@arnested] for the patch
- Array properties specified in ruleset files now have their keys and values trimmed
    - This saves having to do this in individual sniffs and stops errors introduced by whitespace in rulesets
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Added phpcs.xsd to allow validation of ruleset XML files
    - Thanks to [Renaat De Muynck][@renaatdemuynck] for the contribution
- File paths specified using --stdin-path can now point to fake file locations (request [#1488][sq-1488])
    - Previously, STDIN files using fake file paths were excluded from checking
- Setting an empty basepath (--basepath=) on the CLI will now clear a basepath set directly in a ruleset
    - Thanks to [Xaver Loppenstedt][@xalopp] for the patch
- Ignore patterns are now checked on symlink target paths instead of symlink source paths
    - Restores previous behaviour of this feature
- Metrics were being double counted when multiple sniffs were recording the same metric
- Added support for bash process substitution
    - Thanks to [Scott Dutton][@exussum12] for the contribution
- Files included in the cache file code hash are now sorted to aid in cache file reuse across servers
- Windows BAT files can now be used outside a PEAR install
    - You must have the path to PHP set in your PATH environment variable
    - Thanks to [Joris Debonnet][@JorisDebonnet] for the patch
- The JS unsigned right shift assignment operator is now properly classified as an assignment operator
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- The AbstractVariableSniff abstract sniff now supports anonymous classes and nested functions
    - Also fixes an issue with Squiz.Scope.MemberVarScope where member vars of anonymous classes were not being checked
- Added AbstractArraySniff to make it easier to create sniffs that check array formatting
    - Allows for checking of single and multi line arrays easily
    - Provides a parsed structure of the array including positions of keys, values, and double arrows
- Added Generic.Arrays.ArrayIndent to enforce a single tab stop indent for array keys in multi-line arrays
    - Also ensures the close brace is on a new line and indented to the same level as the original statement
    - Allows for the indent size to be set using an "indent" property of the sniff
- Added Generic.PHP.DiscourageGoto to warn about the use of the GOTO language construct
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the contribution
- Generic.Debug.ClosureLinter was not running the gjslint command

- PEAR.Functions.FunctionDeclaration no longer errors when a function declaration is the first content in a JS file
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature now requires the function name to be indented to an exact tab stop
    - If the function name is not the start of the statement, the opening statement must be indented correctly instead
    - Added a new fixable error code PEAR.Functions.FunctionCallSignature.OpeningIndent for this error
- Squiz.Functions.FunctionDeclarationArgumentSpacing is no longer confused about comments in function declarations
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch

    - Makes it easier to identify where the code block exited or returned
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment now supports nullable type hints
- Squiz.Commenting.FunctionCommentThrowTag no longer assigns throw tags inside anon classes to the enclosing function

    - Override the 'requiredSpacesBeforeColon' setting in a ruleset.xml file to change
    - Default remains at 1
    - Thanks to [Nikola Kovacs][@nkovacs] for the patch
- The Squiz standard now ensures array keys are indented 4 spaces from the main statement
    - Previously, this standard aligned keys 1 space from the start of the array keyword
- The Squiz standard now ensures array end braces are aligned with the main statement
    - Previously, this standard aligned the close brace with the start of the array keyword
- The standard for PHP_CodeSniffer itself now enforces short array syntax
- The standard for PHP_CodeSniffer itself now uses the Generic.Arrays/ArrayIndent sniff rules
- Improved fixer conflicts and syntax error handling for a number of sniffs

## [3.1.0] - 2017-09-20

### Changed
- This release includes a change to support newer versions of PHPUnit (versions 4, 5, and 6 are now supported)
    - The custom PHP_CodeSniffer test runner now requires a bootstrap file
    - Developers with custom standards using the PHP_CodeSniffer test runner will need to do one of the following:
        - run your unit tests from the PHP_CodeSniffer root dir so the bootstrap file is included
        - specify the PHP_CodeSniffer bootstrap file on the command line: `phpunit --bootstrap=/path/to/phpcs/tests/bootstrap.php`
        - require the PHP_CodeSniffer bootstrap file from your own bootstrap file
    - If you don't run PHP_CodeSniffer unit tests, this change will not affect you
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- A phpcs.xml or phpcs.xml.dist file now takes precedence over the default_standard config setting
    - Thanks to [Björn Fischer][@Fischer-Bjoern] for the patch
- Both phpcs.xml and phpcs.xml.dist files can now be prefixed with a dot (request [#1566][sq-1566])
    - The order that the files are searched is: .phpcs.xml, .phpcs.xml.dist, phpcs.xml, phpcs.xml.dist
- The autoloader will now search for files during unit tests runs from the same locations as during normal phpcs runs
    - Allows for easier unit testing of custom standards that use helper classes or custom namespaces
- Include patterns for sniffs now use OR logic instead of AND logic
    - Previously, a file had to be in each of the include patterns to be processed by a sniff
    - Now, a file has to only be in at least one of the patterns
    - This change reflects the original intention of the feature
- PHPCS will now follow symlinks under the list of checked directories
    - This previously only worked if you specified the path to a symlink on the command line
- Output from --config-show, --config-set, and --config-delete now includes the path to the loaded config file
- PHPCS now cleanly exits if its config file is not readable
    - Previously, a combination of PHP notices and PHPCS errors would be generated

    - Set the spacingBeforeFirst property (default is 1) in your ruleset.xml file to set the spacing
- Added a new PHP_CodeSniffer\Util\Tokens::$ooScopeTokens static member var for quickly checking object scope
    - Includes T_CLASS, T_ANON_CLASS, T_INTERFACE, and T_TRAIT
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- PHP_CodeSniffer\Files\File::findExtendedClassName() now supports extended interfaces

## [3.0.2] - 2017-07-18

### Changed
- The code report now gracefully handles tokenizer exceptions
- The phpcs and phpcbf scripts are now the only places that exit() in the code
    - This allows for easier usage of core PHPCS functions from external scripts
    - If you are calling Runner::runPHPCS() or Runner::runPHPCBF() directly, you will get back the full range of exit codes
    - If not, catch the new DeepExitException to get the error message ($e->getMessage()) and exit code ($e->getCode());
- NOWDOC tokens are now considered conditions, just as HEREDOC tokens are
    - This makes it easier to find the start and end of a NOWDOC from any token within it
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Custom autoloaders are now only included once in case multiple standards are using the same one
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Improved tokenizing of fallthrough CASE and DEFAULT statements that share a closing statement and use curly braces
- Improved the error message when Squiz.ControlStructures.ControlSignature detects a newline after the closing parenthesis

## [3.0.1] - 2017-06-14

### Security
- This release contains a fix for a security advisory related to the improper handling of a shell command
    - A properly crafted filename would allow for arbitrary code execution when using the --filter=gitmodified command line option
    - All version 3 users are encouraged to upgrade to this version, especially if you are checking 3rd-party code
        - e.g., you run PHPCS over libraries that you did not write
        - e.g., you provide a web service that runs PHPCS over user-uploaded files or 3rd-party repositories
        - e.g., you allow external tool paths to be set by user-defined values
    - If you are unable to upgrade but you check 3rd-party code, ensure you are not using the Git modified filter
    - This advisory does not affect PHP_CodeSniffer version 2.
    - Thanks to [Sergei Morozov][@morozov] for the report and patch

### Changed
- Arguments on the command line now override or merge with those specified in a ruleset.xml file in all cases
- PHPCS now stops looking for a phpcs.xml file as soon as one is found, favoring the closest one to the current dir
- Added missing help text for the --stdin-path CLI option to --help
- Re-added missing help text for the --file-list and --bootstrap CLI options to --help
- Runner::runPHPCS() and Runner::runPHPCBF() now return an exit code instead of exiting directly (request [#1484][sq-1484])
- The Squiz standard now enforces short array syntax by default
- The autoloader is now working correctly with classes created with class_alias()
- The autoloader will now search for files inside all directories in the installed_paths config var
    - This allows autoloading of files inside included custom coding standards without manually requiring them
- You can now specify a namespace for a custom coding standard, used by the autoloader to load non-sniff helper files
    - Also used by the autoloader to help other standards directly include sniffs for your standard
    - Set the value to the namespace prefix you are using for sniff files (everything up to \Sniffs\)
    - e.g., if your namespace format is MyProject\CS\Standard\Sniffs\Category set the namespace to MyProject\CS\Standard
    - If omitted, the namespace is assumed to be the same as the directory name containing the ruleset.xml file
    - The namespace is set in the ruleset tag of the ruleset.xml file
    - e.g., ruleset name="My Coding Standard" namespace="MyProject\CS\Standard"
- Rulesets can now specify custom autoloaders using the new autoload tag
    - Autoloaders are included while the ruleset is being processed and before any custom sniffs are included
    - Allows for very custom autoloading of helper classes well before the boostrap files are included
- The PEAR standard now includes Squiz.Commenting.DocCommentAlignment
    - It previously broke comments onto multiple lines, but didn't align them

### Fixed
- Fixed a problem where excluding a message from a custom standard's own sniff would exclude the whole sniff
    - This caused some PSR2 errors to be under-reported
- Fixed bug [#1442][sq-1442] : T_NULLABLE detection not working for nullable parameters and return type hints in some cases
- Fixed bug [#1447][sq-1447] : Running the unit tests with a PHPUnit config file breaks the test suite
    - Unknown arguments were not being handled correctly, but are now stored in $config->unknown
- Fixed bug [#1449][sq-1449] : Generic.Classes.OpeningBraceSameLine doesn't detect comment before opening brace
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1450][sq-1450] : Coding standard located under an installed_path with the same directory name throws an error
    - Thanks to [Juliette Reinders Folmer][@jrfnl] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1451][sq-1451] : Sniff exclusions/restrictions don't work with custom sniffs unless they use the PHP_CodeSniffer NS
- Fixed bug [#1454][sq-1454] : Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing is not checking spacing on either side of a short ternary operator
    - Thanks to [Mponos George][@gmponos] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1495][sq-1495] : Setting an invalid installed path breaks all commands
- Fixed bug [#1496][sq-1496] : Squiz.Strings.DoubleQuoteUsage not unescaping dollar sign when fixing
    - Thanks to [Michał Bundyra][@michalbundyra] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#1501][sq-1501] : Interactive mode is broken
- Fixed bug [#1504][sq-1504] : PSR2.Namespaces.UseDeclaration hangs fixing use statement with no trailing code

## [2.9.1] - 2017-05-22

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#1442][sq-1442] : T_NULLABLE detection not working for nullable parameters and return type hints in some cases
- Fixed bug [#1448][sq-1448] : Generic.Classes.OpeningBraceSameLine doesn't detect comment before opening brace

## [3.0.0] - 2017-05-04

### Changed
- Added an --ignore-annotations command line argument to ignore all @codingStandards annotations in code comments (request [#811][sq-811])
- This allows you to force errors to be shown that would otherwise be ignored by code comments
    - Also stop files being able to change sniff properties midway through processing
- An error is now reported if no sniffs were registered to be run (request [#1129][sq-1129])
- The autoloader will now search for files inside the directory of any loaded coding standard
    - This allows autoloading of any file inside a custom coding standard without manually requiring them
    - Ensure your namespace begins with your coding standard's directory name and follows PSR-4
    - e.g., StandardName\Sniffs\CategoryName\AbstractHelper or StandardName\Helpers\StringSniffHelper
- Fixed an error where STDIN was sometimes not checked when using the --parallel CLI option
- The is_closure index has been removed from the return value of File::getMethodProperties()
    - This value was always false because T_FUNCTION tokens are never closures
    - Closures have a token type of T_CLOSURE
- The File::isAnonymousFunction() method has been removed
    - This function always returned false because it only accepted T_FUNCTION tokens, which are never closures
    - Closures have a token type of T_CLOSURE
- Includes all changes from the 2.9.0 release

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#834][sq-834] : PSR2.ControlStructures.SwitchDeclaration does not handle if branches with returns
    - Thanks to [Fabian Wiget][@fabacino] for the patch

## [3.0.0RC4] - 2017-03-02

### Security
- This release contains a fix for a security advisory related to the improper handling of shell commands
    - Uses of shell_exec() and exec() were not escaping filenames and configuration settings in most cases
    - A properly crafted filename or configuration option would allow for arbitrary code execution when using some features
    - All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version, especially if you are checking 3rd-party code
        - e.g., you run PHPCS over libraries that you did not write
        - e.g., you provide a web service that runs PHPCS over user-uploaded files or 3rd-party repositories
        - e.g., you allow external tool paths to be set by user-defined values
    - If you are unable to upgrade but you check 3rd-party code, ensure you are not using the following features:
        - The diff report
        - The notify-send report
        - The Generic.PHP.Syntax sniff
        - The Generic.Debug.CSSLint sniff
        - The Generic.Debug.ClosureLinter sniff
        - The Generic.Debug.JSHint sniff
        - The Squiz.Debug.JSLint sniff
        - The Squiz.Debug.JavaScriptLint sniff
        - The Zend.Debug.CodeAnalyzer sniff
    - Thanks to [Klaus Purer][@klausi] for the report

### Changed
- The indent property of PEAR.Classes.ClassDeclaration has been removed
    - Instead of calculating the indent of the brace, it just ensures the brace is aligned with the class keyword
    - Other sniffs can be used to ensure the class itself is indented correctly
- Invalid exclude rules inside a ruleset.xml file are now ignored instead of potentially causing out of memory errors
    - Using the -vv command line argument now also shows the invalid exclude rule as XML
- Includes all changes from the 2.8.1 release

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#1333][sq-1333] : The new autoloader breaks some frameworks with custom autoloaders
- Fixed bug [#1334][sq-1334] : Undefined offset when explaining standard with custom sniffs

## [3.0.0RC3] - 2017-02-02

### Changed
- Added support for ES6 class declarations
    - Previously, these class were tokenized as JS objects but are now tokenized as normal T_CLASS structures
- Added support for ES6 method declarations, where the "function" keyword is not used
    - Previously, these methods were tokenized as JS objects (fixes bug [#1251][sq-1251])
    - The name of the ES6 method is now assigned the T_FUNCTION keyword and treated like a normal function
    - Custom sniffs that support JS and listen for T_FUNCTION tokens can't assume the token represents the word "function"
    - Check the contents of the token first, or use $phpcsFile->getDeclarationName($stackPtr) if you just want its name
    - There is no change for custom sniffs that only check PHP code
- PHPCBF exit codes have been changed so they are now more useful (request [#1270][sq-1270])
    - Exit code 0 is now used to indicate that no fixable errors were found, and so nothing was fixed
    - Exit code 1 is now used to indicate that all fixable errors were fixed correctly
    - Exit code 2 is now used to indicate that PHPCBF failed to fix some of the fixable errors it found
    - Exit code 3 is now used for general script execution errors
- Added PEAR.Commenting.FileComment.ParamCommentAlignment to check alignment of multi-line param comments
- Includes all changes from the 2.8.0 release

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where excluding a file using a @codingStandardsIgnoreFile comment would produce errors
    - For PHPCS, it would show empty files being processed
    - For PHPCBF, it would produce a PHP error
- Fixed bug [#1233][sq-1233] : Can't set config data inside ruleset.xml file
- Fixed bug [#1241][sq-1241] : CodeSniffer.conf not working with 3.x PHAR file

## [3.0.0RC2] - 2016-11-30

### Changed
- Made the Runner class easier to use with wrapper scripts
- Full usage information is no longer printed when a usage error is encountered (request [#1186][sq-1186])
    - Makes it a lot easier to find and read the error message that was printed
- Includes all changes from the 2.7.1 release

### Fixed
- Fixed an undefined var name error that could be produced while running PHPCBF
- Fixed bug [#1167][sq-1167] : 3.0.0RC1 PHAR does not work with PEAR standard
- Fixed bug [#1208][sq-1208] : Excluding files doesn't work when using STDIN with a filename specified

## [3.0.0RC1] - 2016-09-02

### Changed
- Progress output now shows E and W in green when a file has fixable errors or warnings
    - Only supported if colors are enabled
- PHPCBF no longer produces verbose output by default (request [#699][sq-699])
    - Use the -v command line argument to show verbose fixing output
    - Use the -q command line argument to disable verbose information if enabled by default
- PHPBF now prints a summary report after fixing files
    - Report shows files that were fixed, how many errors were fixed, and how many remain
- PHPCBF now supports the -p command line argument to print progress information
    - Prints a green F for files where fixes occurred
    - Prints a red E for files that could not be fixed due to an error
    - Use the -q command line argument to disable progress information if enabled by default
- Running unit tests using --verbose no longer throws errors
- Includes all changes from the 2.7.0 release

### Fixed
- Fixed shell error appearing on some systems when trying to find executable paths

[sq-699]: https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/699

## [3.0.0a1] - 2016-07-20

### Changed
- Min PHP version increased from 5.1.2 to 5.4.0
- Added optional caching of results between runs (request [#530][sq-530])
    - Enable the cache by using the --cache command line argument
    - If you want the cache file written somewhere specific, use --cache=/path/to/cacheFile
    - Use the command "phpcs --config-set cache true" to turn caching on by default
    - Use the --no-cache command line argument to disable caching if it is being turned on automatically
- Add support for checking file in parallel (request [#421][sq-421])
    - Tell PHPCS how many files to check at once using the --parallel command line argument
    - To check 100 files at once, using --parallel=100
    - To disable parallel checking if it is being turned on automatically, use --parallel=1
    - Requires PHP to be compiled with the PCNTL package
- The default encoding has been changed from iso-8859-1 to utf-8 (request [#760][sq-760])
    - The --encoding command line argument still works, but you no longer have to set it to process files as utf-8
    - If encoding is being set to utf-8 in a ruleset or on the CLI, it can be safely removed
    - If the iconv PHP extension is not installed, standard non-multibyte aware functions will be used
- Added a new "code" report type to show a code snippet for each error (request [#419][sq-419])
    - The line containing the error is printed, along with 2 lines above and below it to show context
    - The location of the errors is underlined in the code snippet if you also use --colors
    - Use --report=code to generate this report
- Added support for custom filtering of the file list
    - Developers can write their own filter classes to perform custom filtering of the list before the run starts
    - Use the command line arg `--filter=/path/to/filter.php` to specify a filter to use
    - Extend \PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\Filter to also support the core PHPCS extension and path filtering
    - Extend \PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\ExactMatch to get the core filtering and the ability to use blacklists and whitelists
    - The included \PHP_CodeSniffer\Filters\GitModified filter is a good example of an ExactMatch filter
- Added support for only checking files that have been locally modified or added in a git repo
    - Use --filter=gitmodified to check these files
    - You still need to give PHPCS a list of files or directories in which to check
- Added automatic discovery of executable paths (request [#571][sq-571])
    - Thanks to [Sergei Morozov][@morozov] for the patch
- You must now pass "-" on the command line to have PHPCS wait for STDIN
    - E.g., phpcs --standard=PSR2 -
    - You can still pipe content via STDIN as normal as PHPCS will see this and process it
    - But without the "-", PHPCS will throw an error if no content or files are passed to it
- All PHP errors generated by sniffs are caught, re-thrown as exceptions, and reported in the standard error reports
    - This should stop bugs inside sniffs causing infinite loops
    - Also stops invalid reports being produced as errors don't print to the screen directly
- Sniff codes are no longer optional
    - If a sniff throws an error or a warning, it must specify an internal code for that message
- The installed_paths config setting can now point directly to a standard
    - Previously, it had to always point to the directory in which the standard lives
- Multiple reports can now be specified using the --report command line argument
    - Report types are separated by commas
    - E.g., --report=full,summary,info
    - Previously, you had to use one argument for each report such as --report=full --report=summary --report=info
- You can now set the severity, message type, and exclude patterns for an entire sniff, category, or standard
    - Previously, this was only available for a single message
- You can now include a single sniff code in a ruleset instead of having to include an entire sniff
    - Including a sniff code will automatically exclude all other messages from that sniff
    - If the sniff is already included by an imported standard, set the sniff severity to 0 and include the specific message you want
- PHPCBF no longer uses patch
    - Files are now always overwritten
    - The --no-patch option has been removed
- Added a --basepath option to strip a directory from the front of file paths in output (request [#470][sq-470])
    - The basepath is absolute or relative to the current directory
    - E.g., to output paths relative to current dir in reports, use --basepath=.
- Ignore rules are now checked when using STDIN (request [#733][sq-733])
- Added an include-pattern tag to rulesets to include a sniff for specific files and folders only (request [#656][sq-656])
    - This is the exact opposite of the exclude-pattern tag
    - This option is only usable within sniffs, not globally like exclude-patterns are
- Added a new -m option to stop error messages from being recorded, which saves a lot of memory
    - PHPCBF always uses this setting to reduce memory as it never outputs error messages
    - Setting the $recordErrors member var inside custom report classes is no longer supported (use -m instead)
- Exit code 2 is now used to indicate fixable errors were found (request [#930][sq-930])
    - Exit code 3 is now used for general script execution errors
    - Exit code 1 is used to indicate that coding standard errors were found, but none are fixable
    - Exit code 0 is unchanged and continues to mean no coding standard errors found

### Removed
- The included PHPCS standard has been removed
    - All rules are now found inside the phpcs.xml.dist file
    - Running "phpcs" without any arguments from a git clone will use this ruleset
- The included SVN pre-commit hook has been removed
    - Hooks for version control systems will no longer be maintained within the PHPCS project

    - Makes this sniff more compatible with those that check parenthesis spacing of function calls
- Squiz.WhiteSpace.ObjectOperatorSpacing now has a setting to ignore newline characters around object operators
    - Default remains FALSE, so newlines are not allowed

    - Set the `php_version` config var using `--config-set`, `--runtime-set`, or in a ruleset to specify a specific PHP version
    - The format of the PHP version is the same as the `PHP_VERSION_ID` constant (e.g., 50403 for version 5.4.3)
    - Supported sniffs are Generic.PHP.DisallowAlternativePHPTags, PSR1.Classes.ClassDeclaration, Squiz.Commenting.FunctionComment

## [2.6.2] - 2016-07-14

### Changed
- Added a new --exclude CLI argument to exclude a list of sniffs from checking and fixing (request [#904][sq-904])
    - Accepts the same sniff codes as the --sniffs command line argument, but provides the opposite functionality
- Added a new -q command line argument to disable progress and verbose information from being printed (request [#969][sq-969])

    - Use the command "phpcs --config-set quiet true" to turn quiet mode on by default
- Generic LineLength sniff no longer errors for comments that cannot be broken out onto a new line (request [#766][sq-766])
    - A typical case is a comment that contains a very long URL

- Settings extensions in a ruleset no longer causes PHP notices during unit testing
    - Thanks to [Klaus Purer][@klausi] for the patch
- Version control reports now show which errors are fixable if you are showing sources

## [2.6.0] - 2016-04-04

### Changed
- Paths used when setting CLI arguments inside ruleset.xml files are now relative to the ruleset location (request [#847][sq-847])
    - This change only applies to paths within ARG tags, used to set CLI arguments
    - Previously, the paths were relative to the directory PHPCS was being run from
    - Absolute paths are still allowed and work the same way they always have
    - This change allows ruleset.xml files to be more portable
- Content passed via STDIN will now be processed even if files are specified on the command line or in a ruleset
- When passing content via STDIN, you can now specify the file path to use on the command line (request [#934][sq-934])
    - This allows sniffs that check file paths to work correctly
    - This is the same functionality provided by the phpcs_input_file line, except it is available on the command line
- Files processed with custom tokenizers will no longer be skipped if they appear minified (request [#877][sq-877])
    - If the custom tokenizer wants minified files skipped, it can set a $skipMinified member var to TRUE
    - See the included JS and CSS tokenizers for an example
- Config vars set in ruleset.xml files are now processed earlier, allowing them to be used during sniff registration
    - Among other things, this allows the installed_paths config var to be set in ruleset.xml files
    - Thanks to [Pieter Frenssen][@pfrenssen] for the patch
- Improved detection of regular expressions in the JS tokenizer
- Generic PHP Syntax sniff now uses PHP_BINARY (if available) to determine the path to PHP if no other path is available
    - You can still manually set `php_path` to use a specific binary for testing
    - Thanks to [Andrew Berry][@deviantintegral] for the patch
- The PHP-supplied T_POW_EQUAL token has been replicated for PHP versions before 5.6
- Added support for PHP7 use group declarations (request [#878][sq-878])
    - New tokens T_OPEN_USE_GROUP and T_CLOSE_USE_GROUP are assigned to the open and close curly braces
- Generic ScopeIndent sniff now reports errors for every line that needs the indent changed (request [#903][sq-903])
    - Previously, it ignored lines that were indented correctly in the context of their block
    - This change produces more technically accurate error messages, but is much more verbose
- The PSR2 and Squiz standards now allow multi-line default values in function declarations (request [#542][sq-542])
    - Previously, these would automatically make the function a multi-line declaration
- Squiz InlineCommentSniff now allows docblocks on require(_once) and include(_once) statements
    - Thanks to [Gary Jones][@GaryJones] for the patch
- Squiz and PEAR Class and File sniffs no longer assume the first comment in a file is always a file comment
    - phpDocumentor assigns the comment to the file only if it is not followed by a structural element
    - These sniffs now follow this same rule
- Squiz ClassCommentSniff no longer checks for blank lines before class comments
    - Removes the error Squiz.Commenting.ClassComment.SpaceBefore
- Renamed Squiz.CSS.Opacity.SpacingAfterPoint to Squiz.CSS.Opacity.DecimalPrecision
    - Please update your ruleset if you are referencing this error code directly
- Fixed PHP tokenizer problem that caused an infinite loop when checking a comment with specific content
- Generic Disallow Space and Tab indent sniffs now detect and fix indents inside embedded HTML chunks (request [#882][sq-882])
- Squiz CSS IndentationSniff no longer assumes the class opening brace is at the end of a line
- Squiz FunctionCommentThrowTagSniff now ignores non-docblock comments
- Squiz ComparisonOperatorUsageSniff now allows conditions like while(true)
- PEAR FunctionCallSignatureSniff (and the Squiz and PSR2 sniffs that use it) now correctly check the first argument
    - Further fix for bug [#698][sq-698]

### Fixed
- Fixed bug [#791][sq-791] : codingStandardsChangeSetting settings not working with namespaces
- Fixed bug [#872][sq-872] : Incorrect detection of blank lines between CSS class names
- Fixed bug [#879][sq-879] : Generic InlineControlStructureSniff can create parse error when case/if/elseif/else have mixed brace and braceless definitions

- Fixed bug [#928][sq-928] : Endless loop when sniffing a PHP file with a git merge conflict inside a function
- Fixed bug [#937][sq-937] : Shebang can cause PSR1 SideEffects warning
    - Thanks to [Clay Loveless][@claylo] for the patch
- Fixed bug [#938][sq-938] : CallTimePassByReferenceSniff ignores functions with return value

    - Useful for running the phpcs and phpcbf commands without any arguments at the top of a repository
- Default file paths can now be specified in a ruleset.xml file using the "file" tag
    - File paths are only processed if no files were specified on the command line

- Generic CharacterBeforePHPOpeningTagSniff now allows a shebang line at the start of the file (request [#20481][pear-20481])
- Generic InlineHTMLUnitTest now allows a shebang line at the start of the file (request [#20481][pear-20481])
- PEAR ObjectOperatorIndentSniff now only checks object operators at the start of a line
- PEAR FileComment and ClassComment sniffs no longer have @ in their error codes
    - E.g., PEAR.Commenting.FileComment.Missing@categoryTag becomes PEAR.Commenting.FileComment.MissingCategoryTag
    - Thanks to [Grzegorz Rygielski][@grzr] for the patch
- Squiz ControlStructureSpacingSniff no longer enforces a blank line before CATCH statements
- Squiz FunctionCommentSniff now fixes the return type in the @return tag (request [#392][sq-392])

- Squiz InlineCommentSniff now only disallows lowercase letters at the start of the comment
- Squiz OperatorSpacingSniff now has a setting to ignore newline characters around operators (request [#348][sq-348])
    - Default remains FALSE, so newlines are not allowed
    - Override the "ignoreNewlines" setting in a ruleset.xml file to change
- PSR2 ControlStructureSpacingSniff now checks for, and fixes, newlines after the opening parenthesis
- Added a markdown document generator (--generator=markdown to use)
    - Thanks to [Stefano Kowalke][@Konafets] for the contribution

## [2.0.0a2] - 2014-05-01

### Changed
- Added report type --report=info to show information about the checked code to make building a standard easier
    - Checks a number of things, such as what line length you use, and spacing are brackets, but not everything
    - Still highly experimental
- Generic LineLengthSniff now shows warnings for long lines referring to licence and VCS information
    - It previously ignored these lines, but at the expense of performance
- Generic DisallowTabIndent and DisallowSpaceIndent sniffs no longer error when detecting mixed indent types
    - Only the first type of indent found on a line (space or indent) is considered
- Lots of little performance improvements that can add up to a substantial saving over large code bases
    - Added a "length" array index to tokens so you don't need to call strlen() of them, or deal with encoding
    - Can now use isset() to find tokens inside the PHP_CodeSniffer_Tokens static vars instead of in_array()
- Custom reports can now specify a $recordErrors member var; this previously only worked for built-in reports
    - When set to FALSE, error messages will not be recorded and only totals will be returned
    - This can save significant memory while processing a large code base
- Removed dependence on PHP_Timer
- PHP tokenizer now supports DEFAULT statements opened with a T_SEMICOLON
- The Squiz and PHPCS standards have increased the max padding for statement alignment from 8 to 12
- Squiz EchoedStringsSniff now supports statements without a semicolon, such as PHP embedded in HTML
- Squiz DoubleQuoteUsageSniff now properly replaces escaped double quotes when fixing a doubled quoted string
- Improved detection of nested IF statements that use the alternate IF/ENDIF syntax
- PSR1 CamelCapsMethodNameSniff now ignores magic methods
    - Thanks to [Eser Ozvataf][@eser] for the patch
- PSR1 SideEffectsSniff now ignores methods named define()
- PSR1 and PEAR ClassDeclarationSniffs now support traits (request [#20208][pear-20208])

## [2.0.0a1] - 2014-02-05

### Changed
- Added the phpcbf script to automatically fix many errors found by the phpcs script
- Added report type --report=diff to show suggested changes to fix coding standard violations
- The --report argument now allows for custom reports to be used
    - Use the full path to your custom report class as the report name
- The --extensions argument is now respected when passing filenames; not just with directories
- The --extensions argument now allows you to specify the tokenizer for each extension
    - e.g., `--extensions=module/php,es/js`
- Command line arguments can now be set in ruleset files
    - e.g., `arg name="report" value="summary"` (print summary report; same as `--report=summary`)
    - e.g., `arg value="sp"` (print source and progress information; same as `-sp`)
    - The `-vvv`, `--sniffs`, `--standard` and `-l` command line arguments cannot be set in this way
- Sniff process() methods can now optionally return a token to ignore up to
    - If returned, the sniff will not be executed again until the passed token is reached in the file
    - Useful if you are looking for tokens like T_OPEN_TAG but only want to process the first one
- Removed the comment parser classes and replaced it with a simple comment tokenizer
    - T_DOC_COMMENT tokens are now tokenized into T_DOC_COMMENT_* tokens so they can be used more easily
    - This change requires a significant rewrite of sniffs that use the comment parser
    - This change requires minor changes to sniffs that listen for T_DOC_COMMENT tokens directly
- Added Generic DocCommentSniff to check generic doc block formatting
    - Removed doc block formatting checks from PEAR ClassCommentSniff
    - Removed doc block formatting checks from PEAR FileCommentSniff

    - Removed doc block formatting checks from Squiz FunctionCommentSniff
    - Removed doc block formatting checks from Squiz VariableCommentSniff
- Squiz DocCommentAlignmentSniff has had its error codes changed
    - NoSpaceBeforeTag becomes NoSpaceAfterStar
    - SpaceBeforeTag becomes SpaceAfterStar
    - SpaceBeforeAsterisk becomes SpaceBeforeStar
- Generic MultipleStatementAlignment now aligns assignments within a block so they fit within their max padding setting
    - The sniff previously requested the padding as 1 space if max padding was exceeded
    - It now aligns the assignment with surrounding assignments if it can
    - Removed property ignoreMultiline as multi-line assignments are now handled correctly and should not be ignored
- Squiz FunctionClosingBraceSpaceSniff now requires a blank line before the brace in all cases except function args
- Added error Squiz.Commenting.ClassComment.SpacingAfter to ensure there are no blank lines after a class comment
- Added error Squiz.WhiteSpace.MemberVarSpacing.AfterComment to ensure there are no blank lines after a member var comment
    - Fixes have also been corrected to not strip the member var comment or indent under some circumstances
    - Thanks to [Mark Scherer][@dereuromark] for help with this fix
- Added error Squiz.Commenting.FunctionCommentThrowTag.Missing to ensure a throw is documented
- Removed error Squiz.Commenting.FunctionCommentThrowTag.WrongType
- Content passed via STDIN can now specify the filename to use so that sniffs can run the correct filename checks
    - Ensure the first line of the content is: phpcs_input_file: /path/to/file
- Squiz coding standard now enforces no closing PHP tag at the end of a pure PHP file
- Squiz coding standard now enforces a single newline character at the end of the file
- Squiz ClassDeclarationSniff no longer checks for a PHP ending tag after a class definition
- Squiz ControlStructureSpacingSniff now checks TRY and CATCH statements as well
- Removed MySource ChannelExceptionSniff

## [1.5.2] - 2014-02-05

## [1.5.1] - 2013-12-12

### Changed

    - Runtime values are the same as config values, but are not written to the main config file
    - Thanks to [Wim Godden][@wimg] for the patch
- Config values can now be set in ruleset files
    - e.g., config name="zend_ca_path" value="/path/to/ZendCodeAnalyzer"
    - Can not be used to set config values that override command line values, such as show_warnings
    - Thanks to [Jonathan Marcil][@jmarcil] for helping with the patch

    - By default, standards have to be installed into the CodeSniffer/Standards directory to be considered installed
    - New config value allows a list of paths to be set in addition to this internal path
    - Installed standards appear when using the -i arg, and can be referenced in rulesets using only their name

    - There is no longer a need to keep the list of errors and warnings in memory during a run
- Multi-file sniff support has been removed because they are too memory intensive
    - If you have a custom multi-file sniff, you can convert it into a standard sniff quite easily

- Added pattern matching support to Generic ForbiddenFunctionsSniff
    - If you are extending it and overriding register() or addError() you will need to review your sniff

    - Not every sniff will work correctly due to the lack of a valid file path
- PHP_CodeSniffer_Exception no longer extends PEAR_Exception (request [#18483][pear-18483])

## 1.3.0RC2 - 2011-01-14

### Changed
- You can now print multiple reports for each run and print each to the screen or a file (request [#12434][pear-12434])
    - Format is `--report-[report][=file]` (e.g., `--report-xml=out.xml`)
    - Printing to screen is done by leaving `[file]` empty (e.g., `--report-xml`)
    - Multiple reports can be specified in this way (e.g., `--report-summary --report-xml=out.xml`)
    - The standard `--report` and `--report-file` command line arguments are unchanged
- Added `-d` command line argument to set `php.ini` settings while running (request [#17244][pear-17244])
    - Usage is: `phpcs -d memory_limit=32M -d ...`
    - Thanks to [Ben Selby][@benmatselby] for the patch
- Added -p command line argument to show progress during a run
    - Dot means pass, E means errors found, W means only warnings found and S means skipped file
    - Particularly good for runs where you are checking more than 100 files
    - Enable by default with --config-set show_progress 1
    - Will not print anything if you are already printing verbose output
    - This has caused a big change in the way PHP_CodeSniffer processes files (API changes around processing)
- You can now add exclude rules for individual sniffs or error messages (request [#17903][pear-17903])
    - Only available when using a ruleset.xml file to specify rules
    - Uses the same exclude-pattern tags as normal but allows them inside rule tags
- Using the -vvv option will now print a list of sniffs executed for each file and how long they took to process
- Added Generic ClosureLinterSniff to run Google's gjslint over your JS files
- The XML and CSV reports now include the severity of the error (request [#18165][pear-18165])
    - The Severity column in the CSV report has been renamed to Type, and a new Severity column added for this
- Fixed issue with Squiz FunctionCommentSniff reporting incorrect type hint when default value uses namespace
    - Thanks to Anti Veeranna for the patch
- Generic FileLengthSniff now uses iconv_strlen to check line length if an encoding is specified (request [#14237][pear-14237])
- Generic UnnecessaryStringConcatSniff now allows strings to be combined to form a PHP open or close tag
- Squiz SwitchDeclarationSniff no longer reports indentation errors for BREAK statements inside IF conditions
- Interactive mode now always prints the full error report (ignores command line)
- Improved regular expression detection in JavaScript files
    - Added new T_TYPEOF token that can be used to target the typeof JS operator
    - Fixes bug [#17611][pear-17611] : Regular expression tokens not recognised
- Squiz ScopeIndentSniff removed
    - Squiz standard no longer requires additional indents between ob_* methods
    - Also removed Squiz OutputBufferingIndentSniff that was checking the same thing
- PHP_CodeSniffer_File::getMemberProperties() performance improved significantly
    - Improves performance of Squiz ValidVariableNameSniff significantly
- Squiz OperatorSpacingSniff performance improved significantly
- Squiz NonExecutableCodeSniff performance improved significantly
    - Will throw duplicate errors in some cases now, but these should be rare
- MySource IncludeSystemSniff performance improved significantly
- MySource JoinStringsSniff no longer reports an error when using join() on a named JS array
- Warnings are now reported for each file when they cannot be opened instead of stopping the script
    - Hide warnings with the -n command line argument
    - Can override the warnings using the code Internal.DetectLineEndings

## 1.3.0RC1 - 2010-09-03

### Changed
- Added exclude pattern support to ruleset.xml file so you can specify ignore patterns in a standard (request [#17683][pear-17683])

    - See CodeSniffer/Standards/PHPCS/ruleset.xml for an example
- Added new --encoding command line argument to specify the encoding of the files being checked
    - When set to utf-8, stops the XML-based reports from double-encoding
    - When set to something else, helps the XML-based reports encode to utf-8
    - Default value is iso-8859-1 but can be changed with `--config-set encoding [value]`

## 1.0.0 - 2007-12-21

### Changed
- You can now specify the full path to a coding standard on the command line (feature request [#11886][pear-11886])
