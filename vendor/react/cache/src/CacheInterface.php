     * it, it may take a while.
     *
     * The optional `$ttl` parameter sets the maximum time-to-live in seconds
     * for this cache item. If this parameter is omitted (or `null`), the item
     * will stay in the cache for as long as the underlying implementation

     *
     * This interface does not enforce any particular TTL resolution, so special
     * care may have to be taken if you rely on very high precision with
     * millisecond accuracy or below. Cache implementations SHOULD work on a
     * best effort basis and SHOULD provide at least second accuracy unless
     * otherwise noted. Many existing cache implementations are known to provide
     * microsecond or millisecond accuracy, but it's generally not recommended
     * to rely on this high precision.
     *
     * This interface suggests that cache implementations SHOULD use a monotonic
     * time source if available. Given that a monotonic time source is only
     * available as of PHP 7.3 by default, cache implementations MAY fall back
     * to using wall-clock time.
     * While this does not affect many common use cases, this is an important
     * distinction for programs that rely on a high time precision or on systems
     * that are subject to discontinuous time adjustments (time jumps).
     * This means that if you store a cache item with a TTL of 30s and then
     * adjust your system time forward by 20s, the cache item SHOULD still
     * expire in 30s.
