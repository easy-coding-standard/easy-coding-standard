## 1.0.0 (2018-07-11)

*   First stable LTS release, now following [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
    We'd like to emphasize that this component is production ready and battle-tested.
    We plan to support all long-term support (LTS) releases for at least 24 months,
    so you have a rock-solid foundation to build on top of.

>   Contains no other changes, so it's actually fully compatible with the v0.7.7 release.

    bytes to write at once.
    (#105 by @clue)

    ```php
    $stream = new WritableResourceStream(STDOUT, $loop, null, 8192);
    ```

*   Ignore HHVM test failures for now until Travis tests work again
    (#106 by @clue)

## 0.7.0 (2017-05-04)

*   Removed / BC break: Remove deprecated and unneeded functionality
    (#45, #87, #90, #91 and #93 by @clue)

    *   Remove deprecated `Stream` class, use `DuplexResourceStream` instead
        (#87 by @clue)
      
    *   Remove public `$buffer` property, use new constructor parameters instead
        (#91 by @clue)

    *   Remove public `$stream` property from all resource streams
        (#90 by @clue)

    *   Remove undocumented and now unused `ReadableStream` and `WritableStream`
        (#93 by @clue)

    *   Remove `BufferedSink`
        (#45 by @clue)

*   Feature / BC break: Simplify `ThroughStream` by using data callback instead of
    inheritance. It is now a direct implementation of `DuplexStreamInterface`.
    (#88 and #89 by @clue)

    ```php
    $through = new ThroughStream(function ($data) {
        return json_encode($data) . PHP_EOL;
    });
    $through->on('data', $this->expectCallableOnceWith("[2, true]\n"));

    $through->write(array(2, true));
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: The `CompositeStream` starts closed if either side is
    already closed and forwards pause to pipe source on first write attempt.
    (#96 and #103 by @clue)
    
    If either side of the composite stream closes, it will also close the other
    side. We now also ensure that if either side is already closed during
    instantiation, it will also close the other side.

*   BC break: Mark all classes as `final` and
    mark internal API as `private` to discourage inheritance
    (#95 and #99 by @clue)

*   Feature / BC break: Only emit `error` event for fatal errors
    (#92 by @clue)

    >   The `error` event was previously also allowed to be emitted for non-fatal
        errors, but our implementations actually only ever emitted this as a fatal
        error and then closed the stream.

*   Feature: Explicitly allow custom events and exclude any semantics
    (#97 by @clue)

*   Strict definition for event callback functions
    (#101 by @clue)

*   Support legacy PHP 5.3 through PHP 7.1 and HHVM and improve usage documentation
    (#100 and #102 by @clue)

*   Actually require all dependencies so this is self-contained and improve
    forward compatibility with EventLoop v1.0 and v0.5
    (#94 and #98 by @clue)

## 0.6.0 (2017-03-26)

* Feature / Fix / BC break: Add `DuplexResourceStream` and deprecate `Stream`
  (#85 by @clue)

  ```php
  // old (does still work for BC reasons)
  $stream = new Stream($connection, $loop);

  // new
  $stream = new DuplexResourceStream($connection, $loop);
  ```

  Note that the `DuplexResourceStream` now rejects read-only or write-only
  streams, so this may affect BC. If you want a read-only or write-only
  resource, use `ReadableResourceStream` or `WritableResourceStream` instead of
  `DuplexResourceStream`.

  > BC note: This class was previously called `Stream`. The `Stream` class still
    exists for BC reasons and will be removed in future versions of this package.

* Feature / BC break: Add `WritableResourceStream` (previously called `Buffer`)
  (#84 by @clue)

  ```php
  // old
  $stream = new Buffer(STDOUT, $loop);

  // new
  $stream = new WritableResourceStream(STDOUT, $loop);
  ```

* Feature: Add `ReadableResourceStream`
  (#83 by @clue)

  ```php
  $stream = new ReadableResourceStream(STDIN, $loop);
  ```

* Fix / BC Break: Enforce using non-blocking I/O
  (#46 by @clue)

  > BC note: This is known to affect process pipes on Windows which do not
    support non-blocking I/O and could thus block the whole EventLoop previously.

* Feature / Fix / BC break: Consistent semantics for
  `DuplexStreamInterface::end()` to ensure it SHOULD also end readable side
  (#86 by @clue)

* Fix: Do not use unbuffered reads on pipe streams for legacy PHP < 5.4
  (#80 by @clue)

## 0.5.0 (2017-03-08)

* Feature / BC break: Consistent `end` event semantics (EOF)
  (#70 by @clue)
  
  The `end` event will now only be emitted for a *successful* end, not if the
  stream closes due to an unrecoverable `error` event or if you call `close()`
  explicitly.
  If you want to detect when the stream closes (terminates), use the `close`
  event instead.

* BC break: Remove custom (undocumented) `full-drain` event from `Buffer`
  (#63 and #68 by @clue)

  > The `full-drain` event was undocumented and mostly used internally.
    Relying on this event has attracted some low-quality code in the past, so
    we've removed this from the public API in order to work out a better
    solution instead.
    If you want to detect when the buffer finishes flushing data to the stream,
    you may want to look into its `end()` method or the `close` event instead.

* Feature / BC break: Consistent event semantics and documentation,
  explicitly state *when* events will be emitted and *which* arguments they
  receive.
  (#73 and #69 by @clue)

  The documentation now explicitly defines each event and its arguments.
  Custom events and event arguments are still supported.
  Most notably, all defined events only receive inherently required event
  arguments and no longer transmit the instance they are emitted on for
  consistency and performance reasons.

  ```php
  // old (inconsistent and not supported by all implementations)
  $stream->on('data', function ($data, $stream) {
      // process $data
  });

  // new (consistent throughout the whole ecosystem)
  $stream->on('data', function ($data) use ($stream) {
      // process $data
  });
  ```

  > This mostly adds documentation (and thus some stricter, consistent 
    definitions) for the existing behavior, it does NOT define any major
    changes otherwise.
    Most existing code should be compatible with these changes, unless
    it relied on some undocumented/unintended semantics.

* Feature / BC break: Consistent method semantics and documentation
  (#72 by @clue)

  > This mostly adds documentation (and thus some stricter, consistent
    definitions) for the existing behavior, it does NOT define any major
    changes otherwise.
    Most existing code should be compatible with these changes, unless
    it relied on some undocumented/unintended semantics.

* Feature: Consistent `pipe()` semantics for closed and closing streams
  (#71 from @clue)

  The source stream will now always be paused via `pause()` when the
  destination stream closes. Also, properly stop piping if the source
  stream closes and remove all event forwarding.

* Improve test suite by adding PHPUnit to `require-dev` and improving coverage.
  (#74 and #75 by @clue, #66 by @nawarian)

## 0.4.6 (2017-01-25)

* Feature: The `Buffer` can now be injected into the `Stream` (or be used standalone)
  (#62 by @clue)

* Fix: Forward `close` event only once for `CompositeStream` and `ThroughStream`

* Fix: Consistent `close` event behavior for `Buffer`
  (#61 by @clue)

## 0.4.5 (2016-11-13)

* Feature: Support setting read buffer size to `null` (infinite)
  (#42 by @clue)

* Fix: Do not emit `full-drain` event if `Buffer` is closed during `drain` event
  (#55 by @clue)

* Vastly improved performance by factor of 10x to 20x.
  Raise default buffer sizes to 64 KiB and simplify and improve error handling
  and unneeded function calls.
  (#53, #55, #56 by @clue)

## 0.4.4 (2016-08-22)
