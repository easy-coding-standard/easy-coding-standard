/**
 * Cooperatively resolves hosts via the given base executor to ensure same query is not run concurrently
 *
 * Wraps an existing `ExecutorInterface` to keep tracking of pending queries
 * and only starts a new query when the same query is not already pending. Once
 * the underlying query is fulfilled/rejected, it will forward its value to all
 * promises awaiting the same query.
 *
 * This means it will not limit concurrency for queries that differ, for example
 * when sending many queries for different host names or types.
 *
 * This is useful because all executors are entirely async and as such allow you
 * to execute any number of queries concurrently. You should probably limit the
 * number of concurrent queries in your application or you're very likely going
 * to face rate limitations and bans on the resolver end. For many common
 * applications, you may want to avoid sending the same query multiple times
 * when the first one is still pending, so you will likely want to use this in
 * combination with some other executor like this:
 *
 * ```php
 * $executor = new CoopExecutor(
 *     new RetryExecutor(
 *         new TimeoutExecutor(
 *             new UdpTransportExecutor($nameserver),
 *             3.0
 *         )
 *     )
 * );
 * ```
