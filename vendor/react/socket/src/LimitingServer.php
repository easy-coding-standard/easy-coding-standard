 *
 * Whenever the underlying server emits a `connection` event, it will check its
 * limits and then either
 * - keep track of this connection by adding it to the list of
 *   open connections and then forward the `connection` event
 * - or reject (close) the connection when its limits are exceeded and will
 *   forward an `error` event instead.
 *
 * Whenever a connection closes, it will remove this connection from the list of
 * open connections.
 *
 * ```php
 * $server = new React\Socket\LimitingServer($server, 100);

     * Instantiates a new LimitingServer.
     *
     * You have to pass a maximum number of open connections to ensure
     * the server will automatically reject (close) connections once this limit
     * is exceeded. In this case, it will emit an `error` event to inform about
     * this and no `connection` event will be emitted.
     *
     * ```php
     * $server = new React\Socket\LimitingServer($server, 100);
     * $server->on('connection', function (React\Socket\ConnectionInterface $connection) {
     *     $connection->write('hello there!' . PHP_EOL);
     *     …
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * You MAY pass a `null` limit in order to put no limit on the number of
     * open connections and keep accepting new connection until you run out of
     * operating system resources (such as open file handles). This may be
     * useful if you do not want to take care of applying a limit but still want
     * to use the `getConnections()` method.
     *
     * You can optionally configure the server to pause accepting new
     * connections once the connection limit is reached. In this case, it will
     * pause the underlying server and no longer process any new connections at
     * all, thus also no longer closing any excessive connections.
     * The underlying operating system is responsible for keeping a backlog of
     * pending connections until its limit is reached, at which point it will
     * start rejecting further connections.
     * Once the server is below the connection limit, it will continue consuming
     * connections from the backlog and will process any outstanding data on
     * each connection.
     * This mode may be useful for some protocols that are designed to wait for
     * a response message (such as HTTP), but may be less useful for other
     * protocols that demand immediate responses (such as a "welcome" message in
     * an interactive chat).
     *
     * ```php
     * $server = new React\Socket\LimitingServer($server, 100, true);
     * $server->on('connection', function (React\Socket\ConnectionInterface $connection) {
     *     $connection->write('hello there!' . PHP_EOL);
     *     …
