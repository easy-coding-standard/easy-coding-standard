 * The `ConnectorInterface` is responsible for providing an interface for

 *
 * This is the main interface defined in this package and it is used throughout
 * React's vast ecosystem.
 *
 * Most higher-level components (such as HTTP, database or other networking
 * service clients) accept an instance implementing this interface to create their
 * TCP/IP connection to the underlying networking service.
 * This is usually done via dependency injection, so it's fairly simple to actually
 * swap this implementation against any other implementation of this interface.
 *
 * The interface only offers a single `connect()` method.
